In my case I wanted to simply return the inverted (!) result of the designated function. I have other ways to accomplish the goal. My question is what might the MS designers have been thinking when deciding to seal Predicate&lt;>?</p>

<p>Without much thought I came up with:
(a) simplified their testing, just a time vs cost trade off
(b) ""no good"" could come from deriving from Predicate&lt;></p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>Update: There are n predicates that are dynamically added to a list of Predicates during an initialization phase. Each is mutually exclusive (if Abc is added, NotAbc wont be added). I observed a pattern that looks like:</p>

<pre><code>bool Happy(IMyInterface I) {...}
bool NotHappy(IMyInterface I) { return !Happy(I); }
bool Hungry(IMyInterface I) {...}
bool NotHungry(IMyInterface I) { return !Hungry(I); }
bool Busy(IMyInterface I) {...}
bool NotBusy(IMyInterface I) { return !Busy(I); }
bool Smart(IMyInterface I) {...}
bool NotSmart(IMyInterface I) {...} //Not simply !Smart
</code></pre>

<p>Its not that I can't solve the problem, its that I wonder why I couldn't solve it a certain way.</p>

<p>Let’s say we have a situation where we have 10,000 items implementing a “Press Release” template. These items are stored in Sitecore at <code>/sitecore/content/home/press/*</code>. On our homepage, we’d like to display some information concerning the 3 most recent press releases.</p>

<p>We’re looking to construct something equivalent to SQL’s:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT TOP 3 * FROM PressReleases ORDER BY ReleaseDate
</code></pre>

<p>Reading through the Sitecore query documentation, it sounds like the majority of this query must be handled in our C# application. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>public Item[] GetRecentPressReleases()
{
   string query = ""/sitecore/content/home/press/*"";
   Item[] items = Sitecore.Context.Database.SelectItems(query);
   Array.Sort(items, new PressReleaseDateComparer());
   return items.Take(3).ToArray();
}
</code></pre>

<p>It would seem that loading 10,000 Sitecore items from the database into memory and then sorting them every time our homepage is hit would be unacceptable from a performance perspective.</p>

<p>Is there a more efficient way to express this query? Or should I be focused on output caching and/or pre-calculating?</p>

<p>In C# the string keyword (highlighted in Visual Studio as a data type) is just a shortcut to the String class right?</p>

<p>In that case, it would be the same to use either while coding from the semantic point of view. However, is it the same from the performance point of view? I mean, when the mapping is performed: during compilation (I guess so), during compilation or during JIT compilation in execution? </p>

<p>Or maybe this is all wrong: string and String are not the same thing in C# so there are some situations where they cannot be interchanged</p>

How do I sort the elements in <strong>descending order</strong>?</p>
<p>Unfortunately the Java API doesn't support sorting of <strong>primitive</strong> types with a Comparator.</p>
<p>The first approach that probably comes to mind is to convert it to a list of objects (boxing):</p>
<pre><code>double[] array = new double[1048576];    
Arrays.stream(array).boxed().sorted(Collections.reverseOrder())…

<p>This solution is probably good enough for many (or even most) use cases but <strong>boxing</strong> each primitive in the array is <strong>too slow and causes a lot of GC pressure</strong> if the array is large!</p>
<p>Another approach would be to sort and then reverse:</p>
<pre><code>double[] array = new double[1048576];
...
Arrays.sort(array);
// reverse the array
for (int i = 0; i &lt; array.length / 2; i++) {
     // swap the elements
     double temp = array[i];
     array[i] = array[array.length - (i + 1)];
     array[array.length - (i + 1)] = temp;
}
   
</code></pre>
<p><strong>This approach can also be too slow</strong> if the array is already sorted quite well.</p>
<p>What's a better alternative if the arrays are large and performance is the major optimization goal?</p>

I'm using mod_proxy and mod_proxy_ajp to forward the requests to tomcat. My server is running Ubuntu. Now I'm trying to use mod_rewrite to remove the leading www, so that my canonical website URL is <code>http://example.com</code> rather than <code>http://www.example.com</code></p>
<p>I've read a number of tutorials on using mod_rewrite, but I can't get any rewriting to work. I've tried putting the rewrite rule in an <code>.htaccess</code> file (after modifying my <code>/etc/apache/sites-available/default</code> file to set AllowOverride all). I've tried putting the rewrite rule in <code>apache2.conf</code>, <code>httpd.conf</code>, and <code>rewrite.conf</code>. I've tried all of these with rewrite logging turned on. The log file gets created, but Apache has written nothing to it. I thought maybe mod_proxy was somehow preventing the rewrite rules from being used, so I tried disabling that as well...and I still get no rewrite, and nothing to the log.</p>
<p>At this point I have absolutely no idea what to try next. How do I go about troubleshooting why Apache isn't using my rewrite rules?</p>
<p>For reference, here are my rewrite directives:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;

    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.example.com$ [NC]
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://example.com/$1 [R=301,L]
    RewriteLog &quot;/var/log/apache2/rewrite.log&quot;
    RewriteLogLevel 3

&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>the responses below are helpful to my particular case, but probably not as helpful to the community-at-large as answers about how you troubleshoot Apache directives in general. For example, is there a way to enable logging to the point where it would tell me which directives are being applied in which order as the request comes in?</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: I've gotten things to work now. My virtual hosts weren't quite set up right, and I also didn't quite have the rewrite regex right. Here is the final rewrite directives I got to work:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.example\.com [NC]

<p>There are sites like eBay and Amazon, which cannot be completely stateless, as they have a shopping cart or something like that. It isn't feasible to encode every item in the shopping cart into the URL, nor is it feasible to encode every item into a cookie and send it at every connection. So Amazon simply stores the session-id into the cookie which is being sent. So I understand that the scalability of the web tier of eBay and Amazon should be much harder than the scalability of the google search engine, where everything can be encoded restful into the URL. </p>

<p>On the other hand, both eBay as well as Amazon scaled absolutely massively. Rumor is that there are some 15000 J2EE Application Servers at eBay.</p>

<p>How do these sites handle both: extreme scalability and statefulness? As the site is stateful, it isn't feasible to do a simple DNS-Balancing. So one would assume that these companies have a hardware based load balancer like BigIP, Netscaler or something like that, which is the sole device behind the single IP address of that site. This load balancer would decrypt the SSL (if encoded), inspect the cookie and decide depending on the session id of that cookie which application server holds the session of that customer.</p>

<p>But this just can't possibly work as no single load-balancer could possibly handle the load of thousands of application servers? I would imagine that even these hardware load balancers do not scale to such a level.</p>

<p>Also, the load-balancing is being done transparently for the user, i.e. the users are not forwarded to different addresses, but still all collectively stay at www.amazon.com the whole time.</p>

<p>So my question is: Is there some special trick with which one can achieve something like transparent sharding of the web tier (not the database tier as done commonly)? As long as the cookie isn't inspected there is no way to know which application server is holding this session.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I realized that there is only a need for transparency, if there is a need for the site to be spidered and bookmarked. E.g. if the site is a mere web app, something like a plane or train ticket reservation system, there should be no problem with just redirecting the users to specific clusters of web servers behind different urls, e.g. a17.ticketreservation.com. In this specific case, it would be feasible to just use multiple clusters of application servers, each behind his own load balancer.
Interestingly, I did not find a site which uses this kind of concept.
<strong>Edit:</strong> I found this concept <a href=""http://highscalability.com/save-load-balancer-using-client-side-load-balancing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">discussed</a> at <a href=""http://highscalability.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">highscalability.com</a>, where the discussion refers to an article by Lei Zhu named <strong><a href=""http://www.digital-web.com/articles/client_side_load_balancing/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Client Side Load Balancing for Web 2.0 Applications""</a></strong>. Lei Zhu uses cross scripting to do this client side load balancing transparently.</p>

<p>Even if there are drawbacks, like bookmarking, xss, etc, I do think that this sounds like a extremely good idea for certain special situations, namely almost content-free web applications, which are not needed to be spidered or bookmarked (e.g. ticket reservation systems or something like that). Then there is no need to do the load balancing transparently.</p>

<p>There could be a simple redirect from the main site to the server, e.g. a redirect from www.ticketreservation.com to a17.ticketreservation.com. From there on the user stays at the server a17. a17 is not a server, but a cluster itself, by which redundancy could be achieved.</p>

<p>The initial redirect server could itself be a cluster behind a load balancer. This way, a really high scalability could be achieved, as the primary load balancer behind www is only hit once at the beginning of each session.</p>

<p>Of course, the redirect to different urls looks extremely nasty, but with mere web applications (which do not need to be spidered, deep-linked or deep-bookmarked anyway), this should be only an optical problem for the user?</p>

<p>The redirect-cluster could poll the load of the application clusters and adapt the redirects accordingly, thus achieving balancing and not mere load distribution.</p>

<pre><code>- (id)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame {

    if (self = [super initWithFrame:frame]) {
        int i, j;

        UIView *tile;       

        for (i = 0; i&lt;maxCol; i++) {
            for (j = 0; j &lt; maxRow; j++) {
                frame.origin.x =  i * (TILE_SPACING) + TILE_PADDING;
                frame.origin.y =  j * (TILE_SPACING) + TILE_PADDING;
                tile = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:frame];

                [self addSubview:tile];
                [tile release]; 
            }
        }

    }
    return self;
}


- (void)touchesBegan: (NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {
    UIView *tile = [self hitTest:[[touches anyObject] locationInView:self] withEvent:nil];

    if (tile != self)
        [tile setHidden:YES];
}



- (void)touchesMoved: (NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {
    UIView *tile = [self hitTest:[[touches anyObject] locationInView:self] withEvent:nil];

    if (tile != self)
        [tile setHidden:YES];

<p>This approach works but however if the tiles get denser (i.e. small tiles and more tiles on the screen). The iPhone is less responsive as the finger move. It may be the hitTest taking a toll on the processor as it struggles to keep up but would like some opinions.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is this an efficient way / right way to implement the touchesMoved?</p></li>
<li><p>If it isn't, what would be the recommended approach?</p></li>
<li><p>I tried moving the functionality into a custom Tile class (a sub UIView) which the class above would create and add as a subview. This subview Tile can handle the TouchesBegan but as the finger move, the other tiles does not receive the TouchesBegan even since the touches are still part of the initial touch sequence. Is there a way to implement it through the subview Tile class, how do other tiles receive the TouchesBegan/TouchesMoved event as the finger move?</p></li>

However, I am unable to access the message ID of getMessage() on the jthrowable object, and I don't know why.  I've tried changing the signature of getMessage to ""()Ljava/lang/String"" (without the semicolon at the end, but that's necessary, right?) with no joy.  I'm confused as hell about this.  I even tried replacing getMessage with toString, and <em>that</em> didn't work.  Obviously I'm doing something trivially wrong here.</p>

<p>Here's the code I'm using:</p>

<pre><code>jthrowable java_exception;
jclass java_class;
jmethodID method;

java_exception = (*jEnv)-&gt;ExceptionOccurred(jEnv);
assert (java_exception != NULL);

method = (*jEnv)-&gt;GetMethodID (jEnv, java_class, ""getMessage"", ""()Ljava/lang/String;"");
if (method == NULL) {
printf (""Seriously, how do I get here?!\n"");
(*jEnv)-&gt;ExceptionDescribe (jEnv);
return;
}

<p>This might be better explained by a counter-example - I maintain an app that prints two graphics as part of a print advertisement. They're stored in the database as <code>TopLogo</code> and <code>LowerLogo</code>, which I have to stop and double-check every time I use them because I'm expecting <code>top</code> to complement <code>bottom</code>, and <code>lower</code> should complement <code>upper</code>. </p>

<p>There's some obvious examples that I think work well:</p>

<p><code>client / server</code><br>
<code>source / target</code> for copying/moving data or files from one variable to another<br>
<code>minimum / maximum</code>  </p>

<p>but there's some concepts that just don't lend themselves to such neat naming schemes. For example, when paging through records, does 'last' mean 'final' or 'previous' ? I recently saw some  code that used <code>firstPage</code>, <code>previousPage</code>, <code>nextPage</code> and <code>finalPage</code> to avoid the ambiuous <code>lastPage</code> completely, which I thought was very beat, hence this question.</p>

<p>Do you have any particularly neat variable name pairs you'd care to share with us? (Bonus points if they're the same length, which makes the code so much neater in monospaced fonts.)</p>

When I send a request to the server, I send this variable's value, then increment it by one (for the next request to the server). The server keeps track of this counter independantly, and checks to make sure that the count sent by the client is 1 more than it's own (server-side) copy of the count. This is all fine and dandy, but consider the following situation:</p>

<ol>
<li>The client sends, say, 23 to the server.</li>
<li>The server receives 23, validates it, and increments its own counter to 23.</li>
<li>The server returns the All-Okay code to the client</li>
</ol>

<p>-BUT-</p>

<p>Along the way from the server to the client, the return code gets corrupted. The client thus thinks that the server did not update its counter, and so leaves the client-side counter at 23. From this point onwards, the client and server are out of sync.</p>

Since I think the solution was cool I am sharing it here while I am waiting for an answer to the question I posted earlier.  I need to know the relative position for the column headings in a table so I know how to match the column heading up with the data in the rows below.  I found some of my tables had the following row as the first row in the table</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- Table Width Row --&gt;

&lt;TD width=""60%""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt; &lt;!-- colindex=01 type=maindata --&gt;

 &lt;/TR&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I thought wow, this will be easy because the data is in the column below type=body.  Counting down I knew that in the data rows I would need to get the values in columns [3, 7, 11, 15].  So I set out to accomplish that using this code:</p>

<pre><code>indexComment = souptoGetColIndex.findAll(text=re.compile(""type=body""))
indexRow=indexComment[0].findParent()
indexCells=indexRow.findAll(text=re.compile(""type=body""))
for each in range(len(indexCells)):
    collist.append(tdlist.index(indexCells[each].previousSibling.previousSibling))
</code></pre>

<p>what I got back was collist=[0, 3, 7, 7, 15]</p>

<p>It turns out I think that because cells in the 7th and 11th position looked exactly alike the same index position was returned.  I was trying to figure out how to deal with this, clearly I had to make them look different.  So what I did was make them look different by first using a readlines to read each line of the file in and change the blank spaces to a random integer.</p>

<pre><code>for each in toGetColIndex:
   newlt.append(each.replace(r""&amp;nbsp;"",str(random.randint(1,14567))))
</code></pre>

<p>a friend pointed out that I could lower overhead by using this instead</p>

<pre><code>for each in toGetColIndex:
   newlt.append(each.replace(r""&amp;nbsp;"",str(toGetColIndex.index(each))))
</code></pre>

<p>Nonetheless, each of these approaches gets me a list with the colindex for the location of my headers for each column and to use on the data rows.  Note that replace function is missing the blank space since I guess the html is causing it to disappear the actual code uses r""&amp;.n.b.s.p;"" without the periods</p>

<pre><code>main = do
    let list = []
    loadNums ""dictionary.txt"" list

loadNums location list = do
    inh &lt;- openFile location ReadMode

<p>Probably because the hGetLine isn't a String, but a IO String, which I have no idea how to handle in order to obtain a proper string I can insert in my list.

I found a really good library, doing exactly what's needed, but it is written in Python. I decided to experiment with embedding Python code in C++, using the Boost.Python library.</p>

<p>The C++ code looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;boost/python.hpp&gt;

using namespace boost::python;

int main(int, char **) 
{
    Py_Initialize();

    try 
    {
        object module((handle&lt;&gt;(borrowed(PyImport_AddModule(""__main__"")))));

        object name_space = module.attr(""__dict__"");
        object ignored = exec(""from myModule import MyFunc\n""
                          ""MyFunc(\""some_arg\"")\n"",
                          name_space);

        std::string res = extract&lt;std::string&gt;(name_space[""result""]);
    } 
    catch (error_already_set) 
    {
        PyErr_Print();
    }

    Py_Finalize();
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>A (very) simplified version of the Python code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>import thirdparty

def MyFunc(some_arg):
    result = thirdparty.go()
    print result
</code></pre>

<p>Now the problem is this: 
'MyFunc' executes fine, i can see the print of 'result'.
What i cannot do is read 'result' back from the C++ code. The extract command never finds 'result' in any namespace.
I tried defining 'result' as a global, i even tried returning a tuple, but i cannot get it to work.</p>

<p>This is not a REBOL-specific question. You can answer it in any language.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.rebol.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">REBOL</a> language supports the creation of domain-specific languages known as ""dialects"" in REBOL <em>parlance</em>. I've created such a dialect for list comprehensions, which aren't natively supported in REBOL.</p>

<p>A good cartesian product algorithm is needed for list comprehensions.</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>I've used meta-programming to solve this, by dynamically creating and then executing a sequence of nested <code>foreach</code> statements. It works beautifully. However, because it's dynamic, the code is not very readable. REBOL doesn't do recursion well. It rapidly runs out of stack space and crashes. So a recursive solution is out of the question.</p>

<p>In sum, I want to replace my meta-programming with a readable, non-recursive, ""inline"" algorithm, if possible. The solution can be in any language, as long as I can reproduce it in REBOL. (I can read just about any programming language: C#, C, C++, Perl, Oz, Haskell, Erlang, whatever.)</p>

<p>I should stress that this algorithm needs to support an arbitrary number of sets to be ""joined"", since list comprehension can involve any number of sets.</p>
