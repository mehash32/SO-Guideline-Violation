<p>I did a quick test on my local machine (sql 2005) using it as both the publisher and subscriber and had no trouble setting it up. I repeated a similar process for the real servers using enterprise manager for the 2000 publisher parts and management studio to setup the PULL subscriber. This all seemed to work and the publisher logs seem to be indicating it was preparing the initial data however I am not getting anything coming over as of yet. I checked the logs and am getting an os error 3. I have included the two log sections I think are important below.</p>

Is the following trail of thought the correct way to implement this:
1. Have a .proto file which is the message definition for the incoming request.
2. Write a servlet which accepts this request, does various tasks like querying database
and then sends a response. Will this response require a separate .proto message definition with all the fields that make up the response?
3. Will the client just invoke the doGet() method of my servlet and pass the request, it should then return a response as a protobuff object?</p>

<p>For performance and scalability reasons, I would much prefer to use an event-driven method of gathering information than a poll-based one.  As such, I have been investigating the ManagementEventWatcher class.</p>

<p>For simple monitoring tasks, this class seems to be exactly what I want.  I create the object, give it ManagementScope, EventQuery, and EventWatcherOptions parameters, subscribe to the EventArrived event, and call the Start method (simplified example below).</p>

<pre><code>  using SM = System.Management;

  ...

  SM.ManagementEventWatcher    _watcher;
  SM.ConnectionOptions         conxOptions;
  SM.ManagementScope           scope;
  SM.WqlEventQuery             eventQuery;
  SM.EventWatcherOptions       eventOptions;
  SM.EventArrivedEventHandler  handler;

  string  path = @""\\machine\root\cimv2"";

  conxOptions = new SM.ConnectionOptions ();
  conxOptions.Username = user;
  conxOptions.Password = password;
  scope = new SM.ManagementScope (path, conxOptions);
  scope.Connect ();

  eventQuery = new SM.WqlEventQuery (""SELECT * FROM __InstanceCreationEvent WITHIN 10 WHERE TargetInstance ISA 'Win32_Process'"");

  eventOptions = new SM.EventWatcherOptions ();
  eventOptions.Context.Add (""QueryName"", ""Process Query"");

  _watcher = new SM.ManagementEventWatcher (scope, eventQuery, eventOptions);
  handler = new SM.EventArrivedEventHandler (HandleWMIEvent);
  _watcher.EventArrived += handler;
  _watcher.Start ();

  Console.WriteLine (""Press Any Key To Continue"");
  Console.ReadKey ();

  _watcher.Stop ();
  _watcher.EventArrived -= handler;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I am running into is that it is difficult to detect when the connection to the remote machine has been broken through various means (machine restart, downed router, unplugged network cable, etc.).</p>

<p>The ManagementEventWatcher class does not appear to provide any means of determining that the connection has been lost, as the Stopped event will not fire when this occurs.  The ManagementScope object attached to the ManagementEventWatcher still shows IsConnected as true, despite the broken link.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any ideas on how to check the connection status?</p>

<p>The only thing I can think to do at this point is to use the ManagementScope object to periodically perform a WMI query against the machine and make sure that still works, though that can only check the local->remote connection and not the corresponding remote->local connection.  I suppose I could look up another WMI query I could use to verify the connection (assuming the query works), but that seems like more work than I should have to do.</p>

I want to be able to use its URL pattern, like, <code>http://localhost/controller/function/ID</code>, but by default it has to be <code>http://localhost/index.php/controller/function/ID</code>. The user guide says that I need a .htaccess file to make the former style possible, and uses this as an example:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond $1 !^(index\.php|images|robots\.txt)
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.php/$1 [L]
</code></pre>

<p>But I don't understand how this works. Where should I put the .htaccess? Does it have to be in the server root?</p>

<p>What if I have multiple sites running on my server. Do I have to put it in <code>/var/www/</code> and specify conditions based on what directories are loaded? Or can I just put it in <code>/var/www/site_using_codeigniter/</code>? I'm not sure how to even get this to work.</p>

<p>Can I make it so that it will only map to an MVC URL if the requested URL doesn't actually exist? For example, <code>http://localhost/articles/2009/some-article-name</code> wouldn't be a directory on the server, so it would map to <code>index.php</code> and be given to codeigniter, but <code>http://localhost/forum</code> <em>would</em> exist on the server but shouldn't be handled by codeigniter.</p>

<p>Any other things I should do with a .htaccess file? Anything good to read about them?</p>

<h2>update</h2>

<p>I changed my config file like this:</p>

<pre><code>$config['index_page'] = """"; //used to be ""index.php""
</code></pre>

<p>and added this to a <code>.htaccess</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond $1 !^(index\.php|images|robots\.txt)
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.php/$1 [L]
</code></pre>

<p>and saved it in my sites root directory (in this case <code>/var/www/cms/</code>)</p>

<p>I went into /etc/apache2/conf.d/security (which is included by /etc/apache2/apache2.conf) and did this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Directory /&gt;
    AllowOverride All #was ""none"", but this was all commented out
    Order Deny,Allow
    Deny from all
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It's still not working however. If I navigate to <code>http://localhost/cms/index.php/hello</code>, it prints ""Hello there,"" but <code>http://localhost/cms/hello</code> gives a 404 error.</p>

<p>Ideas?</p>

<h2>update: græt success!</h2>

<p>I had to dig through my apache configuration files to finally find where all the directories were defined (I had never messed around in server config files before this date) and found that pesky <code>AllowOverride None</code> that was foiling my plans for greatness.</p>

<p>Now it works perfectly. All of the answers here are viable and work.</p>

In a third row – Intime is 10:00:00 and Outtime is 16:00:00, so Dateout should display the same date
In a fourth row – Intime is 18:00:00 and Outtime is 21:00:00, so Dateout should display the next day date.

<p>I have to insert a couple million rows in either SQL Server 2000/2005, MySQL, or Access.  Unfortunately I don't have an easy way to use bulk insert or BCP or any of the other ways that a normal human would go about this.  The inserts will happen on one particular database but that code needs to be db agnostic -- so I can't do bulk copy, or SELECT INTO, or BCP.  I can however run specific queries before and after the inserts, depending on which database I'm importing to.</p>

<p>eg.</p>

<pre><code>If IsSqlServer() Then
    DisableTransactionLogging();
ElseIf IsMySQL() Then
    DisableMySQLIndices();
End If

... do inserts ...

If IsSqlServer() Then
    EnableTransactionLogging();
ElseIf IsMySQL() Then
    EnableMySQLIndices();
End If
</code></pre>

<p><strong>QUESTION</strong></p>

<p>Are there any interesting things I can do to SQL Server that might speed up these inserts?</p>

<p>For example, is there a command I could issue to tell SQL Server, ""Hey, don't bother recording these transactions in the transaction log"".</p>

<p>Or maybe I could say, ""Hey, I have a million rows coming in, so don't update your index until I'm totally finished"".</p>

<pre><code>ALTER INDEX [IX_TableIndex] ON Table DISABLE
     ... inserts
ALTER INDEX [IX_TableIndex] ON Table REBUILD
</code></pre>

<p>(Note: Above index disable only works on 2005, not 2000.  Bonus points if you know a way to do this on 2000).</p>

<p>What I wonder is: if I use this pattern with a WCF service, is the service the Model (DataModel), or do I need a separate Model to encapsulate the WCF service layer??</p>

<p>When I use WCF as DataModel my ViewModel is not testable without mocking the whole WCF service, since the calls to WCF need to manage the connection. The calls in this ViewModel look like this:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Sam.Alyza.WcfInterface.Website&gt; rc = null;
Service&lt;Sam.Alyza.WcfInterface.IServiceWebsites&gt;.Use(alyzaSvc =&gt;
{
  rc = new List&lt;Sam.Alyza.WcfInterface.Website&gt;(alyzaSvc.GetSites());
});
</code></pre>

<p>To get my ViewModel testable I tried adding a separate DataModel to abstract WCF connection away. After this the ViewModel was testable, the calls looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Sam.Alyza.WcfInterface.Website&gt; rc = new List&lt;Sam.Alyza.WcfInterface.Website&gt;(_datamodel.GetSites());
</code></pre>

<p>Problem: most of the code that would need to be tested now had moved into the DataModel, which, again, needed WCF to be tested. What remained in the ViewModel was a thin shell, which can be tested. But since the main code moved into the DataModel, so testing the ViewModel was quite useless.</p>

<p>So to me it seems adding a separate DataModel layer to a View / ViewModel application using WCF does add a lot of work, but the testability does not get any better.</p>

<p>I've seen the projects:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://code.google.com/p/fullhistory/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Django Full History (Google Code)</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://code.google.com/p/django-modelhistory/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Django ModelHistory</a>, and</li>
<li><a href=""http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/FullHistory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Django FullHistory</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I've a special use-case that probably falls outside the scope of what these projects provide. Further, I'm wary of how well documented, tested and updated these projects are. In any event, here's the problem I face:</p>

<p>I've a model, likeso:</p>

<pre><code>from django.db import models

class Document(models.Model):
   text_field = models.TextField()
</code></pre>

<p>This text field may be large - over 40k - and I would like to have an autosave feature that saves the field every 30 seconds or so. This could make the database unwieldly large, obviously, if there are a lot of saves at 40k each (probably still 10k if zipped). The best solution I can think of is to keep a difference between the most recent saved version and the new version.</p>

<p>However, I'm concerned about race conditions involving parallel updates. There are two distinct race conditions that come to mind (the second much more serious than the first):</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>HTTP transaction race condition</strong>: User A and User B request document X0, and make changes individually, producing Xa and Xb. Xa is saved, the difference between X0 and Xa being ""Xa-0"" (""a less not""), Xa now being stored as the official version in the database. If Xb subsequently saves, it overwrite Xa, the diff being Xb-a (""b less a"").</p>

<p>While not ideal, I'm not overly concerned with this behaviour. The documents are overwriting each other, and users A and B may have been unaware of each other (each having started with document X0), but the history retains integrity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Database read/update race condition</strong>: The problematic race condition is when Xa and Xb save at the same time over X0. There will be (pseudo-)code something like:</p>

<pre><code> def save_history(orig_doc, new_doc):
     text_field_diff = diff(orig_doc.text_field, new_doc.text_field)
     save_diff(text_field_diff)
</code></pre>

<p>If Xa and Xb both read X0 from the database (i.e. orig_doc is X0), their differences will become Xa-0 and Xb-0 (as opposed to the serialized Xa-0 then Xb-a, or equivalently Xb-0 then Xa-b). When you try to patch the diffs together to produce the history, it will fail on either patch Xa-0 or Xb-0 (which both apply to X0). The integrity of the history has been compromised (or has it?).</p>

<p>One possible solution is an automatic reconciliation algorithm, that detects these problems <em>ex-post</em>. If rebuilding the history fails, one may assume that a race condition has occurred, and so apply the failed patch to prior versions of the history until it succeeds.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I'd be delighted to have some feedback and suggestions on how to go about tackling this problem.</p>

<p>Incidentally, insofar as it's a useful way out, I've noted that Django atomicity is discussed here:</p>

Our clients all use a piece of software we wrote in Visual Studio 2005 (running .NET framework 3.5).  The application is a setup project that gets its files from another project.  The problem is that whenever I do a code change and upload the new version to the server, certain pc's don't get the change.  Here's the steps we do for upgrading:</p>

<ol>
<li>Uninstall the old software using Add/Remove Programs.</li>
<li>Reboot the machine.</li>
<li>Go to our website and run the setup.msi file.</li>
<li>Install the new software.</li>
<li>Run the application.</li>
</ol>

<p>The problem is that when they run the application, they are still getting the old version.  It only occurs on certain pc's with no particular pattern.  I'm positive it's not internet caching because a co-worker copied the msi file over there directly through ftp.  We get around the problem by copying our installed directory, including the manifest, deploy, exe and all that stuff, onto their pc.  That seems to work, but it shouldn't be necessary.  I'm stumped.  I've tried everything.  I can't duplicate the problem--the setup works fine for me; even if I have the old version, it upgrades it.  Is Windows somehow caching the setup or something I should know about?  Please help :)  Thanks!</p>

The static import was of a method from a DA class, which has mostly static methods. So in middle of the business logic I had a da activity that apparently seemed to belong to the current class:</p>
<pre><code>import static some.package.DA.*;
class BusinessObject {
  void someMethod() {
    ....
    save(this);
  }
} 
</code></pre>
<p>The reviewer was not keen that I change the code and I didn't but I do kind of agree with him. One reason given for not static-importing was it was confusing where the method was defined, it wasn't in the current class and not in any superclass so it too some time to identify its definition (the web based review system does not have clickable links like IDE :-) I don't really think this matters, static-imports are still quite new and soon we will all get used to locating them.</p>
<p>But the other reason, the one I agree with, is that an unqualified method call seems to belong to current object and should not jump contexts. But if it really did belong, it would make sense to extend that super class.</p>
<p>So, when <em>does</em> it make sense to static import methods? When have you done it? Did/do you like the way the unqualified calls look?</p>
<p>EDIT: The popular opinion seems to be that static-import methods if nobody is going to confuse them as methods of the current class. For example methods from java.lang.Math and java.awt.Color. But if abs and getAlpha are not ambiguous I don't see why readEmployee is. As in lot of programming choices, I think this too is a personal preference thing.</p>

It's my understanding that the primary use is to hamper a rainbow table attack.  However, the methods I've seen to implement this don't seem to really make the problem harder.</p>

<p>I've seen many tutorials suggesting that the salt be used as the following:</p>

<pre><code>$hash =  md5($salt.$password)
</code></pre>

<p>The reasoning being that the hash now maps not to the original password, but a combination of the password and the salt.  But say <code>$salt=foo</code> and <code>$password=bar</code> and <code>$hash=3858f62230ac3c915f300c664312c63f</code>.  Now somebody with a rainbow table could reverse the hash and come up with the input ""foobar"".  They could then try all combinations of passwords (f, fo, foo, ... oobar, obar, bar, ar, ar).  It might take a few more milliseconds to get the password, but not much else.</p>

<p>The other use I've seen is on my linux system.  In the /etc/shadow the hashed passwords are actually stored <em>with</em> the salt.  For example, a salt of ""foo"" and password of ""bar"" would hash to this: <code>$1$foo$te5SBM.7C25fFDu6bIRbX1</code>.  If a hacker somehow were able to get his hands on this file, I don't see what purpose the salt serves, since the reverse hash of <code>te5SBM.7C25fFDu6bIRbX</code> is known to contain ""foo"".</p>

<p>Thanks for any light anybody can shed on this.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  Thanks for the help.  To summarize what I understand, the salt makes the hashed password more complex, thus making it much less likely to exist in a precomputed rainbow table.  What I misunderstood before was that I was assuming a rainbow table existed for ALL hashes.</p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Collections;

namespace ConsoleApplication1
{
    class Program
    {
        public ArrayList SomeProp { get; set; }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Get the Type of a property by reflection.
            Type myPropType = typeof(Program).GetProperty(""SomeProp"").PropertyType;

            // Create an instance of the determined Type.
            var x = Activator.CreateInstance(myPropType);

            // Now try to use that instance, passing to a method that takes a generic.
            WhatAmI(x);

            Console.ReadKey();
        }

        private static void WhatAmI&lt;T&gt;(T x)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(""T is: "" + typeof(T).FullName);
            Console.WriteLine(""x is: "" + x.GetType().FullName);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output here is:</p>

<pre><code>T is: System.Object
x is: System.Collections.ArrayList
</code></pre>

<p>Basically what is going on here is I have some property on some class. It doesnt really matter what/where that comes from.  The important part is that I get the PropertyInfo for that property.  From there I create a new instance of its Type with Activator.</p>

<p>Now If I pass that created instance to a function that takes a generic parameter, the generic Type always comes across as Object, because Activator.CreateInstance() returns an Object, so ""var x"" is an Object, not, in this case, an ArrayList.</p>

<p>What I need to happen is for the generic type to be the actual type, int his case ""ArrayList"".</p>

<p>I know there is an Activator.CreateInstance() that I can use instead, but I can't use a Type (PropertyInfo.PropertyType) within the angle brackets for that method.</p>

<p>I could also just cast the returned object, like:</p>

<pre><code>myPropType x = (myPropType)Activator.CreateInstance(myPropType);
</code></pre>

<p>But obviously that doesn't compile... Plus it wouldn't be valid anyway because the cast is compile time, and I don't know the type until runtime, but conceptually its what I need...</p>

<p>So I'm stuck with this Type, but I can't figure out how to get it passed over to the WhatAmI() method, and have T be ArrayList, not Object.</p>

<p>Ideas?</p>

<p>Except.</p>

<p>I've been noticing a failure to abide by this in some fairly well-known packages.    </p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://jline.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">JLine</a>: <code>jline.*</code></li>
<li><a href=""https://sourceforge.net/projects/jacob-project/"" rel=""noreferrer"">JACOB</a>: <code>com.jacob.*</code> (there is no jacob.com)</li>

</ul>

<p>So I'm wondering, are there instances where the usual reverse-domain-name convention breaks down, and there are good ways to get around it? The only cases I can think of revolve around domain-name ownership issues (e.g. you change the project hosting/domain name, or there's already a well-known package that has ""squatter's rights"" to your domain, or your ownership of the domain runs out &amp; someone else snaps it up).</p>

<p>edit: if I use my company's domain name, and we are bought out or have a spin-off, what should we do with package names? keep them the same or rename? (I suppose renaming is bad from the point of view that compiled classes referring to the package then lose)</p>

Each Organization can then be at a particular location and have a particular name. The tricky part is that the organizations support location and name changes with a specified effective date of each change. For this example I have 4 relevant tables:</p>

<p>Organization: ID (PK, int, identity) </p>

<p>Location: ID (PK, int, identity), Name (varchar), AltLat (float), AltLong (float)</p>

<p>organization_locations: organization_id(FK, int), location (FK, int), eff_date (datetime)</p>

<p>organization_names: organization_id (FK, int), name (ntext), eff_date (datetime), icon (nvarchar(100))</p>

<p>What I need to retrieve is the list of all locations along with all organizations at a given location as of a specific date and project them into my business entities. In other words, I will have a date provided and need to return for each location, the organization related to the organization_location entry with the most recent eff_date that is less than the date provided. Same thing goes for each organization, I'd need the name as of the date. </p>

<p>Here's what I started with but it doesn't seem to work:</p>

           Where loc.AltLong IsNot Nothing And loc.AltLat IsNot Nothing _

                            .Units = From ol In loc.organization_locations Let o = ol.Organization.organization_names.Where(Function(ed) (ol.eff_date &lt; Date.Parse(""1/1/2011""))).OrderByDescending(Function(od) (od.eff_date)).First() Select New AnnexA.Entities.AnnexAMillitaryUnit With {.ID = o.ID, .Name = o.name, .IconPath = o.icon}}

Problem i am facing is whenever any exception throws during file process thread get stopped. I want the thread to be running even if the exception throws during file processing. It has to move that error to sum other folder and looks for for new file in source folder. How can i make thread to keeps on running?</p>

<p>Actually there are 4 source folders and 4 destination folders. I have to perform the same operation in each source &amp; destination pair. So i have created 4 threads in one class and search operation in second class and file processing in third class.</p>

<p>Actually the two processes in the app I'm working on aren't even two different programs; they're just two instances of the same EXE. I wanted to do something like a singleton app, but have it per user (meaning a Terminal Server or Citrix or App-V server with multiple users should be able to launch their own single copy of the app). If another instance is run by the same user, it should just delegate the task to the already running instance, then exit. Only one instance per user of the program should be running. So far I've done (thanks to StackOverflow) the part that detects whether an instance of the app is already running, using Mutex. But I need the second app instance to be able to send data to the first app instance.</p>

<p>I'm leaning towards using named pipes and WCF's NetNamedPipeBinding for this, but if you have better ideas I'll really appreciate it. Thanks :)</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to change the current directory of an already running open file dialog?</p>

<p><strong>Details:</strong></p>

<p>I have a customized open file dialog (using a custom template to add extra controls) that also has all the validation, existing checks, and creation tests turned off (via the OpenFileName flags).</p>

<p>Turning those things off disables the built-in behavior of the dialog that will cause it to change the currently displayed folder if the user types a folder name into the ""file name"" combo box and hits the enter key.</p>

<p>I would like to add that behavior back. I can detect when this happens via the hook procedure. I've hidden the OK button, turned off it's accelerator, and put my own ""select"" button on the control. This means that the only time I get a CDN_FILEOK message is when the user hits enter in the text box after typing.</p>

<p>I can't, however, figure out how to programatically tell the dialog to change the current directory.</p>

<p>I was thinking that I might be able to accomplish this by sending some sort of a message to the SHELLDLL_DefView control in the window, but I haven't been able to find any documentation on it. </p>

<p>The WaitForSingleObject does wait. Until the application calls ExitProcess the updater does stall.</p>

<p>However, sometimes, when the updater tries to overwrite the application dlls  with the new versions I get a file-locked error which the current version of my updater treats as an unrecoverable error and terminates. It seems that including an arbitrary sleep(100) is sufficient to bypass this ""issue"" but I really hate code like that. really hate.</p>

<p>It seems very odd to me that the process handle can be signalled while the main application is still alive enough to have dll files locked.</p>

<p>I started implementing a HTML Browser in Swing. I want to use the <a href=""http://lobobrowser.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lobo Cobra</a>  toolkit because this toolkit inclused a renderer and parser for CSS and JavaScript. The pages are looking very nice and it is easy to use (one class implementation to show a html page).</p>

<p>I want to show HTML pages in swing which can show javascript generated and modified objects, like a flashing circle.
As far as i know, the cobra toolkit can show static javascript commands like 'document.write' or closwWindow() implementations, but not updating the GUI from a JavaScript.</p>

<p>Did someone works with Lobo Cobra Toolkit before and give me some sample code or tips for showing HTML pages with animated JavaScript objects inside.</p>

<p>While it may be simple for us to upgrade to 2008, we do work with other developers that use 2005 and will not be upgrading to 2008 in the near future.</p>

<p><strong>I understand</strong> that the <em>project</em> files are cross compatible with no problems, but the <em>solution</em> files are <strong>not</strong>.</p>

<p>Here are some links I have come across so far:</p>

</ul>

<p>I am curious, <strong>has MS approached this problem head on?</strong> Have their been any hotfixes to address it? It seems like a pretty poor attempt at cross-compat since there are no <strong>real</strong> changes between the solution files (i.e. 2008 could easily ignore the extra content from 2005)..</p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> This is of course all assuming we do not utilise any of the new framework things in 3.5..</p>
