"2074394","1","2074649","","2010-01-15 19:58:09","","1","194","<p>I was wondering whether it's possible to validate a required size for an icon before trying:</p>

<pre><code>Dim myIcon = New Icon(theIcon, requestedSize).
</code></pre>

<p>This falls over for negative numbers, so that's an easy check.</p>

<p>It appears it falls over if the number is less than half of the smallest icon.
I've looked at the icon class but can see nothing for extracting the sizes.</p>

<p>ETA:</p>

<p>This is pretty annoying. You can put Int32.MaxValue in and it chooses the largest icon. Why it doesn't choose the smallest icon, as long as size > 0 I don't know.
If I can determine the size of the smallest icon, then I can do that myself - with no need to throw an exception.</p>

<p>ETA:</p>

<p>Here's some VB code for anyone who's interested:</p>

<pre><code>//Returns an array of IconMetaData which contains, amongst other things, the size of
// each image in the icon.

&lt;Extension()&gt; _
Public Function GetMetaData(ByVal icon As Icon) As IconMetaData()
    Using s As New System.IO.MemoryStream
        icon.Save(s)
        Using r As New BinaryReader(s)
            s.Position = 0
            Dim Header As New IconHeader(r)
            Dim Data As New List(Of IconMetaData)
            For i As Integer = 0 To Header.NumberOfIcons - 1
                Dim d As New IconMetaData(r)
                *See note below. 
                If d.Height &lt;&gt; 0 AndAlso d.Width &lt;&gt; 0 Then
                    Data.Add(d)
                End If
            Next
            Return Data.ToArray
        End Using
    End Using
End Function

    Public Sub New(ByVal r As BinaryReader)
        r.ReadInt16() //Reserved

<p>*Note: From the couple of icons i've tested this with, the first entry has dimensions of (0,0). I don't know why, and I can't be sure that all icons have this entry, or that it's always the first. Therefore, I check each one.</p>

<p>ETA: On further investigation, i've found that 0 is used to indicate an icon of size 256.</p>

<li>I have to create a function named <code>setUpTranslation()</code>. The purpose of the function is to place the French phrases into the document and set up the event handlers for the mouse-down and mouse-up events.</li>
</ul>
<p>To create the For Loop it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>create a for loop that loops through each of the objects in the phrases collection. For each object in the collection do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Change the inner content of the second child node of the object to french[i] where i is the value of the counter variable for the for loop.</li>
<li>Run the swapFE() function in response to the mouse-down event occurring within the object's second child node</li>
<li>Run the swapEF() function in response to a mouse-up event occurring within the object's second child node.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Then after setting up the for loop I'm to work on the <code>swapFE()</code> and <code>swapEF()</code> functions, but right now I'm just trying to fix the for loop.</p>
<p>Here's what I have so far for the <code>setUpTranslation</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>function setUpTranslation() {
   var phrases = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;p&quot;);   
   
   for (i = 0; i&lt; phrases.length; i++) {
       
  }

}
</code></pre>
<p>I have tried numerous code in the for loop but none of it seems to display the French phrase.</p>

<p>The Javascript API lets you know if you are connected to Facebook or not, but it seems that this can't be done from the PHP client library.</p>

<p>The scenario where I need it is similar to the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Log in to <a href=""http://www.somethingtoputhere.com/therunaround"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""The Run Around"">The Run Around</a> using Facebook connect.</li>
<li>Open <a href=""http://www.facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Facebook, duh"">Facebook</a> in another tab.</li>
<li>Log out from the Facebook tab (not The Run Around).</li>
<li>Go back to the Run Around tab.</li>
<li>Enter a new entry, but deactivate the ""Publish this run to Facebook"" checkbox.</li>
</ol>

<p>After submitting the form your run will get published though you logged out before! After that call, the site will log you out because the Javascript API will try to validate your status.</p>

<p>In the 5th step, the application should check with Facebook if the session has expired or not (or use a workaround). The Connect implementation of The Run Around is flawed and shouldn't be used as an example because of this security issue.</p>

<p>In the last one I did, some of the entries has a weird bad character in front of the actual data, and it got imported in my database. Now I'm looking for a way to clean it up.</p>

<p>The bad data is in the mysql column 'email', it seems to be always right in front of the actual data. When trying to print it on my screen using PHP, it shows up as �. When exporting it to a CSV file, it looks like Â , and if I <code>SET CHARACTER SET utf8</code> before printing it on the screen using PHP, it looks like a normal space ' '.</p>

<p>I was thinking of writing a PHP script that goes over all my rows one at a time, fix the email address field, and update the row. However I'm not quite sure about the ""fix the email"" part!</p>

<p>I was thinking maybe to do a ""explode"" and use the bad character as a delimiter, but I don't know how to type that character into my code.</p>

<p>Is there maybe a way to find the underlying value/utf8/hex or whatever of that character, then find it in the string?</p>

<p>I hope it's clear enough.</p>

In Hex, it looks like it's A0. What can I do to search and delete a character by its hex value? Either in PHP or directly in MySQL I guess ...</p>

<pre><code>public interface ITreeVisitor&lt;T, U&gt;
{
    U Visit(Nil&lt;T&gt; s);
    U Visit(Node&lt;T&gt; s);
}

<p>Anytime I want to pass in a visitor, I have to create a visitor class, implement the interface, and pass it in like this:</p>

<pre><code>class InsertVisitor&lt;T&gt; : ITreeVisitor&lt;T, Tree&lt;T&gt;&gt; where T : IComparable&lt;T&gt;
{
    public T v { get; set; };

    public Tree&lt;T&gt; Visit(Nil&lt;T&gt; s)
    {
        return new Node&lt;T&gt;() { Left = Tree&lt;T&gt;.empty, Value = v, Right = Tree&lt;T&gt;.empty };
    }

    public Tree&lt;T&gt; Visit(Node&lt;T&gt; s)
    {
        switch (v.CompareTo(s.Value))
        {
            case -1: return new Node&lt;T&gt;() { Left = Insert(v, s.Left), Value = s.Value, Right = s.Right };
            case 1: return new Node&lt;T&gt;() { Left = s.Left, Value = s.Value, Right = Insert(v, s.Right) };
            default: return s;
        }
    }
}

public static Tree&lt;T&gt; Insert&lt;T&gt;(T value, Tree&lt;T&gt; tree) where T : IComparable&lt;T&gt;
{
    return tree.Accept&lt;Tree&lt;T&gt;&gt;(new InsertVisitor&lt;T&gt;() { v = value });
}

For this I used:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src=""test_svg.php"" /&gt;

<p>The text fields have helper text set, and when you tap them the keyboard shows and allows you to enter text.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the text fields do not clear the helper text, show the edit caret or show the text being entered (as in the screenshot below).</p>

</p>

<p>Any suggestions? </p>

<p>The window is being displayed with <code>[self presentModalViewController:&lt;controller_name&gt; animated:YES];</code>, which may or may not be the cause of this issue - when I run the UI via the Interface Builder 'test' application the text boxes respond like normal.</p>

<p><code>Clear when editing begins</code> has been set for both fields.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p><em>Edited: More information</em>
After the info Bart Gottschalk provided I thought I should add some more information. First, the application is a Navigation Based Application.</p>

<p>Secondly, the test app Bart recommended worked fine, so that takes the modal window and the view out of the equation.</p>

<p>Third, I was presenting the modal view when the <code>-(void)viewWillAppear...</code> delegate method was being called - which may very well be the wrong place... however I'm not 100% sure if I should be presenting the modal view from within the <code>didFinishLaunchingWithOptions</code> of the App Delegate...</p>

<p>(this is happening on Simulator and iPhone 3.1.3)</p>

    $km = $r * $c;
    return floor($km * 0.621371192);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This one returns a bool if the distance between the 2 sets of lat and long's is under 10.</p>

<pre><code>function is_within_10_miles($lat1, $lng1, $lat2, $lng2){
    $d = distance($lat1, $lng1, $lat2, $lng2);

        return True;
    }else{
        return False;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Both functions work as expected, if i give 2 sets of lat/longs and the distance between them is say 20 miles, my is_within_10_miles() function returns false.</p>

<p>Now, I have a database of 'locations' (4 fields - ID, name, lat, long).</p>

<p>I want to find all locations that are within a 10 mile radius.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: I can loop through ALL the and perform the is_within_10_miles() on them like this</strong></p>

<pre><code>$query = ""SELECT * FROM `locations`"";
$result = mysql_query($query);

while($location = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)){
echo $location['name']."" is "";
echo distance($lat2, $lon2, $location['lat'], $location['lon']);
echo "" miles form your house, is it with a 10 mile radius? "";
if( is_within_10_miles($lat2, $lon2, $location['lat'], $location['lon']) ){
    echo ""yeah"";
}else{
    echo ""no"";
}
echo ""&lt;br&gt;"";

<p>}</p>

<p>A sample result would be</p>

<pre><code>goodison park is 7 miles form your house, is it with a 10 mile radius? yeah

"2296839","1","2298858","","2010-02-19 14:09:03","","3","2551","<p>I am currently thinking about with what pattern I should solve the following issue.</p>

<p>I've got an entity called <code>IdentificationRequest</code>. This entity is used to identify a <code>Person</code> by some criteria.</p>

<pre><code>public class IdentificationRequest
{
     public IdentificationCriteria Criteria;
     public Person IdentifiedPerson;

     protected internal virtual void RedirectToManualIdentification()
     {
        ChangeState(IdentificationRequestState.ManualIdentificationRequested);
     }

     public virtual void StartManualIdentification()
     {
        ChangeState(IdentificationRequestState.ManualIdentificationInProgress);
     }

     public virtual void AssignIdentifiedPerson(Person person)
     {
        identifiedPerson = person;
        ChangeState(IdentificationRequestState.IdentificationFinished);       
     }
}

public class IdentificationCriteria
{
     public string Name;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is a simplified example. In realitiy the <code>IdentificationRequest</code> contains much more information, as well as the <code>IdentificationCriteria</code>.</p>

<p>So basically a client creates an <code>IdentificationRequest</code> with its <code>IdentificationCriteria</code> and then the correct <code>Person</code> needs to be identified. For this, the criteria needs to be passed to the persistence layer to check whether there is a person in the database matching the criteria. If not person can be found, a human interaction is then required to assign the correct <code>Person</code> to the request.</p>

<p>For the process of identification I am currently using a service. Like:</p>

<pre><code>    public class IdentificationService : IIdentificationService
        {
            private readonly IPersonRepository personRepository ;
            private readonly IIdentificationRequestRepository identificationRequestRepository;

            public IdentificationService(IPersonRepository personRepository )
            {
                this.personRepository = personRepository ;
            }

            public bool IdentifyPerson(IdentificationRequest identificationRequest)
            {
                var matches = personRepository.FindByIdentificationCriteria(identificationRequest.Criteria);

                // some additional post analysis of the matches returned from the persistence layer
                var criteriaAnalyzer = new IdentificationCriteriaAnalyzer(identificationRequest.Criteria);
                var uniqueMatch = criteriaAnalyzer.TryIdentify(matches);

                if(uniqueMatch != null)
                {
                    identificationRequest.AssignIdentifiedPerson(uniqueMatch);
                    return true;
                }
                else
                {
                    identificationRequest.RedirectToManualIdentification();
                    return false;
                }            
            }
        }
</code></pre>

<p>This service is part of the domain assembly. Now my question is, if that is the right pattern to perform the identification? Or would I use a factory, to create the identification request and then directly try to identify it, like:</p>

<pre><code>public class IdentificationRequestFactory
{
    private readonly IPersonRepository personRepository;

    public IdentificationRequestFactory(IPersonRepository personRepository)
    {
        this.personRepository = personRepository;
    }

    public IdentificationRequest Create(IdentificationCriteria identificationCriteria)
    {
        var request = new IdentificationRequest(identificationCriteria);

        var matches = personRepository.FindByIdentificationCriteria(identificationRequest.Criteria);
        var criteriaAnalyzer = new IdentificationCriteriaAnalyzer(identificationRequest.Criteria);
        var uniqueMatch = criteriaAnalyzer.TryIdentify(matches);

        if(uniqueMatch != null)
        {
            identificationRequest.AssignIdentifiedPerson(uniqueMatch);

        }
        else
        {
            identificationRequest.RedirectToManualIdentification();

        }

        return request;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This way, an <code>IdentificationRequest</code> can only be constructed by the factory, making sure that the process of identification is done already and the request is in a valid state.</p>

<p>Or would you let the <code>IdentificationRequest</code> identify itself by doing a method injection like:</p>

<pre><code>public class IdentificationRequest
{
    public IdentificationCriteria Criteria;
    public Person IdentifiedPerson;

    public void Identify(IPersonRepository personRepository)
    {
        // identification logic here
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This example would couple the process of identification to the request directly.</p>

<p>What is a common pattern for such a case? Is there a common pattern anyway? What are the pros and cons?</p>

<p>Thx in advance!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Maybe I dont understand the command pattern correctly, but what benefits do I get of it in this case? Is the following implementation correct?</p>

<pre><code>public class IdentificationCommandFactory
{
    private readonly IPersonRepository personRepository;

    public IdentificationCommandFactory(IPersonRepository personRepository)
    {

        this.personRepository = personRepository;
    }

    public IIdentificationCommand Create(IdentificationRequest identificationRequest)
    {
        var matches = personRepository.FindByIdentificationCriteria(identificationRequest);
        var criteriaAnalyzer = new IdentificationCriteriaAnalyzer(identificationRequest);
        var uniqueMatch = criteriaAnalyzer.TryIdentify(matches);

        if(uniqueMatch != null)
        {                
            return new AssignIdentifiedPersonCommand(identificationRequest, uniqueMatch);
        }
        else
        {                
            return new RedirectToManualIdentificationCommand(identificationRequest);
        }    
    }

}

{
    void Execute();
}

public class RedirectToManualIdentificationCommand : IIdentificationCommand
{
    private readonly IdentificationRequest identificationRequest;

    public RedirectToManualIdentificationCommand(IdentificationRequest identificationRequest)
    {
        this.identificationRequest = identificationRequest;
    }

    {
        identificationRequest.RedirectToManualIdentification();
    }
}

<p>I have developed this WinForms client, which interacts with a server (ASPX Application) by means of WCF calls. I would now like to deploy the server to my shared webhost, but I'm kinda new to WCF and especially the security possibilities behind it.</p>

<p>The goal is to kind of secure the WCF service, so that not everybody that knows or finds out the endpoint address can call it. Rather, only my WinForms client must be able to call the WCF service.</p>

<p>I do not need authentication on a user basis, so no authentication is required from the user of the client. <strong>But I want only instances of this WinForms client to be able to interact with the service.</strong> The information passed between server and client is not very sensitive, so it's not really required to secure it, but it's a plus if it can easily be done.</p>

<p>Is this possible with a Shared Host (IIS) environment (no HTTPS at disposal) ? What bindings and options should I use ? I suppose wsHttpBinding, but how would I setup the security options ?</p>

<p>Using .NET 4.0</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>That way I separated the source files from the build system (*.pro). However, when I then run <code>qmake</code> followed by <code>make</code>, the generated files (object files, etc) are placed into the main project folder:</p>

<pre><code>myproject/
    myproject.pro
    Makefile
    main.o
    ui_MainWindow.h
    ...
    src/
        main.cpp
        MainWindow.ui
        ...

<p>Well, at least they weren't put into the <code>src/</code> folder, but how do I specify that they are put into another sub folder such as <code>build/</code>?</p>

<pre><code>myproject/
    myproject.pro
    Makefile
    build/
        main.o
        ui_MainWindow.h
        ...
    src/
        main.cpp
        MainWindow.ui

</code></pre>

<p>I think the best idea is to create an <code>array()</code>, make each <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> an unique row and throw final code to the <code>list.txt</code> file, like:</p>

<pre><code>Array (
 [2] =&gt; stdClass Object (
    [name] =&gt; Djokovic, Novak
    [country] =&gt; SRB
    [rank] =&gt; 6,905
 )
 [3] =&gt; stdClass Object (
    [name] =&gt; Federer, Roger
    [country] =&gt; SUI
    [rank] =&gt; 6,795
 )
)
</code></pre>

<p>We're parsing each <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>[2]</code> is a number from first <code>&lt;td&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>[name]</code> is text of the link inside second <code>&lt;td&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>[country]</code> is a value between (...) in second <code>&lt;td&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>[rank]</code> is the text of the link inside third <code>&lt;td&gt;</code></li>
</ul>

<p>In final file <code>list.txt</code> should contain an <code>array()</code> with ~100 IDS (we are grabbing the page with first 100 players).</p>

<p>Additionally, will be amazing, if we make a small fix for each <code>[name]</code> before adding it to an <code>array()</code>  - <strong>""Federer, Roger""</strong> should be converted to <strong>""Roger Federer""</strong> (just catch the word before comma, throw it to the end of the line).</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

This API doesn't seem to work under certain conditions.  For example, on 10.5 it will work but on 10.6 it won't detect when a new USB headset is plugged in.</p>

<p>I've pared down the problem to a small bit of code that reproduces the problem (it calls AudioObjectGetPropertyDataSize in a loop).  The code will work on 10.6 (ie, it will detect when devices are plugged/unplugged) when its only linked against CoreAudio, but once you link against Foundation <em>it will stop working</em>.</p>

<p>I don't understand how linking to a framework can break code that otherwise works.</p>

<p>Here is the code (coreaudio-test.cpp):</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;CoreAudio/AudioHardware.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    printf(""Press &lt;enter&gt; to refresh device list&gt; \n"");
    while (1) {
        getchar();

        // get device count
        UInt32 dataSize = 0;
        AudioObjectPropertyAddress propertyAddress;
        propertyAddress.mSelector = kAudioHardwarePropertyDevices;
        propertyAddress.mScope    = kAudioObjectPropertyScopeGlobal;
        propertyAddress.mElement  = kAudioObjectPropertyElementMaster;
        OSStatus result =
            AudioObjectGetPropertyDataSize(kAudioObjectSystemObject, &amp;propertyAddress, 0, NULL, &amp;dataSize);

        int count = -1;
        if (result == noErr) {
            count = dataSize / sizeof(AudioDeviceID);
        }
        printf(""num devices= %d \n"", count);
    }

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the Makefile:</p>

<pre><code>LFLAGS= -framework CoreAudio

all: coreaudio-test coreaudio-test.broken

# create a test that works
coreaudio-test: coreaudio-test.cpp
    g++ -o $@ $^ $(LFLAGS)

# linking to foundation will break the test
coreaudio-test.broken: coreaudio-test.cpp
    g++ -o $@ $^ $(LFLAGS) -framework Foundation
</code></pre>

<p>Any thoughts on this bizarre behavior?  (btw, I've also posted this question on the <a href=""http://lists.apple.com/archives/Coreaudio-api/2010/Aug/msg00303.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CoreAudio list</a>.)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2J5Bp.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>One entry can have multiple items of the type ""file"", ""text"" and ""url"". </p>

<p>Everyone of these items has exactly one corresponding item in either the texts, urls or files table - where data is stored.</p>

<p>I need a query to efficiently select an entry with all its corresponding items and their data.</p>

<p>So my first approach was someting like</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM entries LEFT JOIN entries_items LEFT JOIN texts LEFT JOIN urls LEFT JOIN files
</code></pre>

<p>and then loop through it and do the post processing in my application.</p>

<p>But the thing is that its very unlikely that multiple items of different types exist. Its even a rare case that more then one item exists per entry. And  in most cases it will be a file. But I need It anways...</p>

<p>So not to scan all 3 tables for eveyr item I thought I could do something like case/switch and scan the corresponding table based on the value of ""type"" in entries_items.</p>

<p>But I couldn't get it working.</p>

<p>I also thought about making the case/switch logic in the application, but then I would have multiple queries which would probabably be slower as the mysql server will be external.</p>

<p>I can also change the structure if you have a better approach!</p>

<p>I also having all the fields of ""texts"", ""urls"" and ""files"" in side the table entries_items, as its only a 1:1 relation and just have everything that is not needed null.
What would be the pros/cons of that? I think it needs more storage space and i cant do my cosntraints as i have them now. Everything needs also to be null...</p>

<p>Well I am open to all sorts of ideas. The application is not written yet, so I can basically change whatever I like.</p>

<p>I placed two labels in the grid, both in the same column but adjacent rows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Window
xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation""
xmlns:x=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml""
x:Class=""UntitledProject8.Window1""
x:Name=""Window""
Title=""Window1""
Width=""200"" Height=""200""&gt;

&lt;Grid x:Name=""LayoutRoot""&gt;
    &lt;Grid HorizontalAlignment=""Left"" VerticalAlignment=""Top"" Width=""100"" Height=""100""/&gt;
    &lt;Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;
        &lt;RowDefinition Height=""*""/&gt;
        &lt;RowDefinition Height=""*""/&gt;
    &lt;/Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;
    &lt;Label Grid.Row=""0"" Content=""1.23"" FontSize=""18"" HorizontalAlignment=""Center"" VerticalAlignment=""Bottom""/&gt;
    &lt;Label Grid.Row=""1"" Content=""45"" FontSize=""48"" HorizontalAlignment=""Center"" VerticalAlignment=""Top""/&gt;
&lt;/Grid&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>I set the labels' vertical alignment so that the label on row zero is aligned to the bottom and the label on row 1 is aligned to the top.</p>

<p>Now, this is close to what I want but I need the actual text of the label in row 1 to be closer to the text of label in row zero.  To do this I set the margin of the label in row 1 to a negative value:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Window
xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation""
xmlns:x=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml""
x:Class=""UntitledProject8.Window1""

Title=""Window1""
Width=""200"" Height=""200""&gt;

&lt;Grid x:Name=""LayoutRoot""&gt;
    &lt;Grid HorizontalAlignment=""Left"" VerticalAlignment=""Top"" Width=""100"" Height=""100""/&gt;
    &lt;Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;
        &lt;RowDefinition Height=""*""/&gt;
        &lt;RowDefinition Height=""*""/&gt;
    &lt;/Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;
    &lt;Label Grid.Row=""0"" Content=""1.23"" FontSize=""18"" HorizontalAlignment=""Center"" VerticalAlignment=""Bottom""/&gt;
    &lt;Label Grid.Row=""1"" Content=""45"" FontSize=""48"" HorizontalAlignment=""Center"" VerticalAlignment=""Top"" Margin=""0,-20,0,0""/&gt;
&lt;/Grid&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>Is that the right way to do it?  Granted that my examples above are simplistic but as the grid contents grow and get more complicated (such as including other layout containers) is setting different values for control margins the correct way to make adjacent cells closer or farther apart?</p>

<p>I am just a little concerned since I am trying my best to avoid hard coding any types of ""designer"" values like I did when working with WinForms (such as setting exact coords for location and values for sizes) and would like to let the layout manager just take care of it.  However, it looks like setting the margin is the only way to go.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help :)</p>

<p>There is a one to many relationship in my database.</p>

<p>The relationship maps correctly in the designer, and an <code>EntitySet&lt;&gt;</code> property is created in the designer.</p>

<p>When I run the code, the <code>EntitySet&lt;&gt;</code> does not populate with any data, even though there are associated records, they do not populate into the <code>EntitySet&lt;&gt;</code></p>

<p>Am I missing some property or setting?  Do I have to write the query myself? I feel like I'm missing something obvious.</p>

<p>Here is the Designer code:</p>

<pre><code>[Association(Name = ""Bar_Foo"", Storage = ""_Foo"", ThisKey = ""ID"", OtherKey = ""BarID"")]
[DataMember(Order = 15, EmitDefaultValue = false)]
public EntitySet&lt;Foo&gt; Foos
{
    get
    {
        if ((this.serializing &amp;&amp; (this._Foo.HasLoadedOrAssignedValues == false)))
        {
            return null;
        }
        return this._Foo;
    }
    set
    {
        this._Foo.Assign(value);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is the code where I am trying to access the EntitySet&lt;>:</p>

<pre><code>    partial void OnCreated()
    {
        foreach (Foo foo in Foos)
        {
            foo.DoSomething();
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>More information about my situation:</strong></p>

<p>So, from above I have a class Bar with a collection of Foo. What I am trying to do is pass Bar to a UI via a WCF service. Following is my primary service call:</p>

<pre><code>public class TheService : ITheService
{
    public List&lt;Bar&gt; GetBars()
    {
        try
        {
            using (var db = new BarDataContext())
            {
                List&lt;Bar&gt; Bars = new List&lt;Bar&gt;();

                Bars = (from B in db.Bars
                            select B).ToList();

                return Bars;
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            throw new FaultException(ex.Message + "" Something in GetBars() Stack Trace: "" + ex.StackTrace);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Currently, when the service returns the Bars the Foos inside each Bar is null.</p>

<p>If I create a property in Bar that looks at Foos, I get a null reference exception.</p>

<p>I try to run a query in the OnCreated method to fill Foos, the ID of the current Bar is 0.</p>

<p><strong>Updated Query that still doesn't work:</strong></p>

<pre><code>                using (var ctx = new BarDataContext())
            {
                List&lt;Bar&gt; Bars= new List&lt;Bar&gt;();

                Bars= (from B in ctx.Bars
                             select B).ToList();

                foreach (Bar bar in Bars)
                {
                    bar.Foos= (from B in ctx.Bars
                               where B.ID == bar.ID
                               select B.Foos).SingleOrDefault();
                }

                return Bars;
            }
</code></pre>

<p>This code generates a null reference exception when I try to query Foos from Bar.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>The code above magically stopped throwing null reference exceptions, dunno why. I find it interesting that you don't even need to set bar.Foos in the above query, you can put the Foos query into a variable that never gets used and it will fill in the Bar.Foos property, just because you looked at Foos. Reminds me of schrodinger's cat.</p>

<p>Here's the basic idea: </p>

<p>1) The DB Driver uploads an arbitrary string to the DB Server. </p>

<p>2) The DB Driver tells the DB server to run the code and produce a view</p>

<p>3) The DB Server loads my C# backend, hands it the input string</p>

<p>4) The DB Server hands the function to the C# backend</p>

<p>5) The DB Server hands the C# backend data to execute the function over</p>

<p>6) The C# Backend executes the code and result the data to the DB Server</p>

<p>7) The DB Server stores, or otherwise sorts and sends the results back to the DB Driver</p>

<p>So the problem I'm having is with the remote code execution. All my models are C# objects. So it'd be really nice to be able to write the code on the front end, and have the code transfered to the back end for execution. Without having to copy DLLs etc. Now currently in CouchDB this query language is JavaScript so it's super simple to just copy the code into a string.</p>

<p>Any options like this in C#? Can I get a string version of a function? Should I create a external server that hosts these DLL assemblies and serves them up to the CouchDB backends? Should I compile them on the front end, and embed the .cs files as a resource? I'm just brainstorming at this point. Any thoughts/ideas/questions are welcome. </p>

<pre><code>$db-&gt;query(""INSERT INTO unit SET name = 'chrząszcz'"");
</code></pre>

<p>in <code>ZendFramework</code> it works. Problem is with inserting that way:</p>

<pre><code>$unitTable = new Model_Unit_Table();
$unit = $unitTable-&gt;createRow();
$unit-&gt;setFromArray($form-&gt;getValues());
$unit-&gt;save();
</code></pre>

<p><b>UPDATE 2:</b></p>

<p>Problem is with using <code>Zend_Filter_StringToLower</code> - it modifies string <code>chrząszcz</code> into <code>chrz�szcz</code>.<br>
How to get this filterto work correct ?</p>

One is the test snapshot and the other is the production snapshot. The test one is about 500 MB and the production one is about 10 GB. This is because the Test one has many tables truncated. When I restore them in sql server a <code>.mdf</code> file is created at <code>\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.1\MSSQL\Data</code> folder. But I see that the sze of the .mdf file is about 10 GB even when I restore only the test snapshot. Since the test snapshot has many tables truncated and data is less, I would assume that the the size of the .mdf file should be less than that for production snapshot. But that is not the case. Does sql server reserve space in the mdf file and hence it is the same size for both the versions?</p>

<p>My project is a client with an echo server, which shows what errors were introduced in the trip from the client to the server, and then back. And test different error correcting schemes for efficiency and how well they are suited to this task.</p>

<p>The coding isn't really a problem, I was able to make something that would detect errors, ask for retransmission if unable to fix them and such.</p>

<p>The problem I have is that so far, for me to introduce any type of bit error, I must do it artificially -- since other layers of data transfer have their own error correction protocols.</p>

<p>My question: Is there a way to get around this?</p>

<p>I have no idea how I would go about this or even where to begin. </p>

<p>Also, I know there are protocols I can't tinker with so theres always going to be error correction going on in the background at those levels. But what I'd like is to be able to pretend that one of these layers wasn't checking things itself and then my application would be given the chance to play that role.</p>

<p>If this can't be done, what are some good methods of simulating errors introduced during transmission. I was unable to find statistical information about the distribution of errors in even a simple example of a channel. Given those I could continue with the current approach of having the server introduce errors in the message.</p>
