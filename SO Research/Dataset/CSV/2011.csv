"4845175","1","","","2011-01-30 20:05:27","","1","2926","<p>So I have created a model in Ogre3D and this model is made up of a number of triangles of arbitrary rotation and position. I would like to ""unwrap"" the model like many modelling programs do so that all of the triangles are mapped to 2d (x,y) but the triangle sizes are maintained. This is for applying decals. The reason the triangle sizes must be maintained so that when the texture is applied there isn't any stretching.</p>

<p>This was the direction I was thinking of going in but I am having trouble visualizing it and achieving the correct algorithms:</p>

<pre><code>//Verticies will have a converted bool;

func( triangle x):
     for each of x's vertices:
           map to x,y coordinates if not converted;
           check other triangles for common vertex if so call func(common_tri);
</code></pre>

<p>Once this returns there will be a converted version of all of the triangles so that they are all unwrapped and placeable on the texture, where I am having trouble is the mapping to x,y space. I'm not sure how to get a triangle in 3d space to 2d space so that it maintains all of its attributes (like going from an angled view to a perpedicular view of the surface) Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

I have a perplexing interaction between contracts, pex, and quickgraph and would be very grateful for advice from the more knowledgeable. I have boiled it down to a repro case where commenting out one contract makes the false negative go away, but I have been unable to diagnose it with the debugger in the time allowed because the subject code (quickgraph) has side-effects in property-getters, meaning that the debugger executes the side effects when displaying the values of the properties, interfering with the actual order of execution. </p>

<p>First a little background, then the specifics, then a pointer to a project to download and try out, should you be so inclined as to dig in! </p>

<p>I installed Pex &amp; Moles </p>

<p><a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/pex/downloads.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/pex/downloads.aspx</a></p>

<p>and CodeContracts for .NET 4.0</p>

<p><a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/contracts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/contracts/</a></p>

<p>I downloaded, via nuget, the most recent version of QuickGraph, which is all built for .NET 3.5. I pruned it to the minimum I needed, went into Project Properties for all, updated them all to .NET 4.0 from .NET 3.5 Client Profile, fixed one source breaking change (which was trivial and very, very unlikely to have any connection to my problem). I then went to the Code Contracts tab on every project page and enabled all static and dynamic options.</p>

<p><a href=""http://quickgraph.codeplex.com/releases/view/55262"" rel=""nofollow"">http://quickgraph.codeplex.com/releases/view/55262</a> </p>

<p>The project has 192 unit tests, many of them Pex-generated (very nice!). To run the tests, get my project zip file from</p>

<p><a href=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1997638/QuickGraph.zip"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1997638/QuickGraph.zip</a></p>

<p>Make sure you have Pex &amp; Moles and Contracts from the links above. Open the solution, Rebuild everything, then, at the solution level, ""Run All Tests In Solution"" (control-R, A). All will pass. Then go to line 49 of IImplicitUndirectedGraphContracts.cs and uncomment the Contract under the large comment (inserted by me). One test, Prim12240WithDelegate will fail.</p>

<p>That test exercises a graph constructor that builds edges on-the-fly by calling a user-supplied delegate in the property-getters for Edges and EdgeCount. Cute. But something goes wrong with the Contract on line 49 of IImplicitUndirecteGraphContracts.cs. </p>

<p>This is a false negative, because if I comment out this contract, the test passes. In trying to follow this in the debugger, it has something to do with the timing of the creation of the Edges in the property getters. I haven't been able to disentangle this, however, because the debugger calls these getters, the subject code calls them, the contracts code calls them, maybe statically, maybe dynamically, I just plain got lost trying to follow it, and thought I'd bring the question up to those who understand the details of contract execution better than I.</p>

<p>Here is the offending contract; commenting it out makes the unit test succeed:</p>

<pre><code>[Pure]
  IEnumerable&lt;TEdge&gt; IImplicitUndirectedGraph&lt;TVertex, TEdge&gt;.AdjacentEdges(TVertex v)
  {
    IImplicitUndirectedGraph&lt;TVertex, TEdge&gt; ithis = this;
    Contract.Requires(v != null);
    Contract.Requires(ithis.ContainsVertex(v));
    Contract.Ensures(Contract.Result&lt;IEnumerable&lt;TEdge&gt;&gt;() != null);
~~~~~~&gt; Contract.Ensures(
      Enumerable.All(
        Contract.Result&lt;IEnumerable&lt;TEdge&gt;&gt;(),
        edge =&gt; 
          edge != null &amp;&amp; 
          ithis.ContainsEdge(edge.Source, edge.Target) &amp;&amp; 
          (edge.Source.Equals(v) || edge.Target.Equals(v))
        )
      );
    return default(IEnumerable&lt;TEdge&gt;);
  }

<hr>

<p>I have found a way around it by doing the following;</p>

<p>1). Create an NNString with a single character which is an apostrophe</p>

<pre><code>NSString *apostropheString = [[NSString alloc] initWithFormat:@""'""];
</code></pre>

<p>2). Get it to convert it to a unichar called ""app"", as it is zero-indexed and there is only         one character the index is 0.</p>

<pre><code>unichar app = [apostropheString characterAtIndex:0];
</code></pre>

<p>3). I then say if ""thisChar"" is equal to ""app"" run ""qmark""</p>

<pre><code>else if (thisChar == app)
        [self qmark];

<p>I hope this helps for anyone with the same problem!</p>

<p>There is a panel which contains 2 components: a label and a TreeView. The hierarchy, obviously, looks like this:</p>

<pre>panel1  // handles Enter event
   - label1
   - treeView1</pre>

<p>I need to do some UI updates when user starts interacting with any of these 3 controls. My attempted strategy was to catch the <code>Enter</code> event of the <code>panel1</code>, which would fire when user clicks the label or the TreeView. This way, I would write only a single event handler instead of several. While it worked for the TreeView, it didn't work for the label. When I click the label, I don't get the <code>Enter</code> event on the panel. What’s different about the label control?</p>

<p>I could handle the Click event of the label. At the same time, I wonder if there is a more elegant solution.</p>

There are balls bouncing around the window, moving at right-angles when colliding with the sides of the window. The user creates a marquee by dragging the mouse anywhere in the window. When the marquee is created and confirmed, every time a ball hits the marquee it is to be removed. I have my balls in a 2-d array, and I wondered how to remove the balls from this type of array. Currently I am doing the following:</p>

<pre><code>Rectangle ball = new Rectangle((moveBallX - 4), (moveBallY - 4), moveBallX, moveBallY);
Rectangle marquee = new Rectangle(tempInitialX, tempInitialY, tempWidth, tempHeight);
if (ball.Intersects(marquee))
{
    balls[rowIndex, columnIndex].SetRed(0);
    balls[rowIndex, columnIndex].SetGreen(0);
    balls[rowIndex, columnIndex].SetBlue(0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This makes the balls that enter the marquee black, so as they become invisible. I want to do other things with the code such as display the number of balls remaining on the board, so being able to remove the items from the array would be useful.</p>

<p>One of the problems was basically the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">Josephus problem</a></p>

<p>I've studied the Josephus problem before as a discrete math problem, so I basically understand how to get the recurrence:</p>

<pre><code>f(n,k) = (f(n-1,k) + k) mod n, with f(1,k) = 0
</code></pre>

<p>But that didn't work in the Facebook Hacker Cup, because the max value of n was 10^12.  The mak value of k was 10^4.</p>

<p>Wikipedia mentions an approach when k is small and n is large.  Basically remove people from a single round, and then renumber.
But it's not described much and I don't understand why the renumbering works.</p>

<p>I looked at sample working source code for the solution, but I still don't understand that final portion.</p>

<pre><code>long long joseph (long long n,long long k) {
    if (n==1LL) return 0LL;
    if (k==1LL) return n-1LL;
    if (k&gt;n) return (joseph(n-1LL,k)+k)%n;
    long long cnt=n/k;
    long long res=joseph(n-cnt,k);
    res-=n%k;
    if (res&lt;0LL) res+=n;
    else res+=res/(k-1LL);
    return res;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The part I really don't understand is starting from <code>res-=n%k</code> (and the lines thereafter).  How do you derive that that is the way to adjust the result?</p>

<p>Could someone show the reasoning behind how this is derived?  Or a link that derives it?
(I didn't find any info on UVA or topcoder forums)</p>

<p>So I'm using RMI in an Eclipse RCP application. The classloader of RMI and OSGI hate each other so much, but I could solve my first problem <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4650619/eclipse-rcp-rmi-and-bundles"">here</a>.</p>

<p>My server application consists of the <strong>Server</strong> bundle, which depends on <strong>Core</strong>. Additionally the bundle <strong>Map</strong> is loaded, using an extension point of core (<strong>DataUpdate</strong>).</p>

<p>Similarly the <strong>Client</strong> is started depending on <strong>Core</strong> and loading <strong>Map</strong> as a plugin.</p>

<p>Now sending a <strong>User</strong> from the client to the <strong>Server</strong> poses no problem anymore (solved issue above). Sadly the reverse doesn't work. The <strong>Client</strong> is stored as Callback on the <strong>Server</strong> and should receive <strong>DataUpdate</strong> objects. Those are created in the <strong>Map</strong> bundle on the server and sent via RMI. When I receive them on the client side I get the ominous ClassNotFound exception. I do the same as on the server: </p>

<pre><code>Thread.currentThread().setContextClassLoader(
                this.getClass().getClassLoader());
</code></pre>

<p>But this doesn't help. Also to start both server and client my start parameters are: </p>

<pre><code>-consoleLog -Djava.security.policy=java.policy -Djava.rmi.server.codebase=file:${workspace_loc}
</code></pre>

<p>And in the client I set the security manager to a personal implementation which allows everything.</p>

<p>So does anyone have an idea, why the class is not found?</p>

Each vector stores its digits in reverse order, for easier representation by powers of ten. For example, 3497 = 3 * 10^3 + 4 * 10^2 + 9 * 10^1 + 7 *10^0 and is stored in a vector as {7, 9, 4, 3}. Thus, each index of the vector represents that digit's respective power of ten in the integer.</p>

<p>However, I'm having some bugs in my multiplication. 1-digit x 1-digit and 2-digit x 1-digit multiplication work perfectly, but it breaks down at 2-digit x 2-digit. I'm fairly certain that fixing this bug would fix all the other bugs with n-digit x m-digit. My code for both my multiplication and addition methods are below.</p>

<p>By default, the user lands on today's report but then if he clicks on a calendar control and selects a new date, a new report will load for that day. What I want to do is use sessions as a cache for reports. The first time he loads a report for a day, it's loaded from the database into the session and then from the session to the page. Each time he loads a new report for a date, the logic first checks to see if this particular report is in the session and only if it's not is it loaded from the DB. A report has about 15 columns and is made up of about 300-500 rows per day. What will be stored in the session is a dictionary of lists of objects, with the date as the key and the list as the value. I'm using InProc session. I'm also considering storing several other dictionaries as well for other lists of objects.</p>

<p>To request a web page without showing it to the user, it is easy to use XMLHttpRequest but it has its own limitations most importantly it does not retrieve cross-domain pages very well. For security reasons the browsers (Mozilla FireFox 3.6+ in my case) retrieve a header from the target site and if the referrer's location is allowed access in that header, only then will the browser continue getting the target web page and JavaScript can only then parse the retrieved info.
<p>This causes the XMLHttpRequest to work with some pages and not work with others <b>if</b> you are trying to access <b>cross-domain</b> pages. Of course it works well if you need to retrieve the information from the same location as the referrer page where the XMLHttpRequest is located.
<p>This is a big problem, when <b>security</b> is not really no 1 priority. For example, imagine writing a script for retrieving live data from a statistics-producing web site or imagine a bot that needs to retrieve data from an online gaming web-site.
<p>Now, <i>how can JavaScript be used to get pages from other domains (cross-domain reference)?</i>
<p>I thought maybe we could find a plug-in that does the job (of course after installation upon user's permission) and then use its properties by JS and eliminate the need for XMLHttpRequest. <b>Do you know any such plug-in or another roundabout for this problem?

Now, however, it seems like I do; I can't even launch F-Spot, since it crashes on startup. Checking the console, what breaks it is a <code>UriFormatException</code> with the message ""System.UriFormatException: URI scheme must start with a letter and must consist of one of alphabet, digits, '+', '-' or '.' character."". This is running on Mono 2.4.4.0, not Microsoft's runtime.</p>

<p>Basically, I'm trying to find out what exact data rows are broken, so I can either repair them, or file a bug report against F-Spot. (I have been meddling around in the database file directly before, which might have caused this trouble - either way, it'd seem like it should handle something like that better than by crashing hard, but at this very moment I'm more interested in fixing the data than the exact reason why the failure is not being handled in a slightly more graceful manner.) The database is a SQLite3 file, and running it manually in the command-line <code>sqlite3</code> application, I can select both against table metadata as well as the data tables themselves. Yet, I get an unhandled exception <code>System.ApplicationException: file is encrypted or is not a database</code> from Mono.Data.SqliteClient.SqliteConnection.Open() from a simple test application that is all but nothing other than a copy-paste from <a href=""http://www.mono-project.com/SQLite"" rel=""noreferrer"">the official guide for SQLite and Mono</a>. Linking against System.Data.dll and Mono.Data.SqliteClient.dll, I'm copying the relevant code here as well for completeness:</p>

<pre><code>public static void Main(string[] args) {
   string connectionString = ""URI=file:f-spot.photos.db"";
   IDbConnection dbcon;
   dbcon = (IDbConnection) new SqliteConnection(connectionString);
   dbcon.Open();
   dbcon.Close();
   dbcon = null;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The database file is definitely there, and working fine (sqlite3 itself has no complaints about it). Googling nets me lots of pages comparing various small-sized database engines, and hints at the file perhaps being a SQLite2 database. However, AFAIK I have no SQLite2 libraries on my system, and <code>file</code> specifically claims that the file is a ""SQLite 3.x database"". Not only that, F-Spot versions newer than 0.3.5 <a href=""http://f-spot.org/FAQ"" rel=""noreferrer"">require SQLite 3</a>, and I'm on version 0.6.2, and have been for a long while now. Am I trying to read it using the wrong API, or is by any chance the DSN wrong?</p>

<p>Any suggestions on what to try would be appreciated. Sure I can use <code>sqlite3</code> to extract the data, save it to text files, then parse those, but that introduces another couple of layers of uncertainty that I'd really rather avoid if possible by using as close to the same API as F-Spot as I can to access the data.</p>

<p>It works perfectly however when a javascript-enabled user browses the site and wants to share a link on Facebook such as (<code>somesite.com#someotherstate</code>), the Facebook can't parse the proper content of the page since it can't deal with hash parameters for deep-linking.</p>

  <p>Code-Bowling is a challenge for
  writing the most obscure, unoptimized,
  horrific and bastardized code
  possible. Basically, the exact
  opposite of Code-Golf.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The Challenge</strong>:</p>

<p>Create a program that takes a sequence of numbers, and determines if they are in an ascending order.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./myprogram 1 2 7 10 14
true

$ ./myprogram 7 2 0 1
false
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rules</strong>:</p>

<p>There really are none. It can be a console application, it can be a webpage, it can be whatever. It just needs to be a stand-alone program that accepts numbers and returns numbers. The format and methods are 100% up to you.</p>

<p>So have fun, and let's see the bastardized solutions you can come up with!</p>

<p>I have a problem when I am inserting(saving) data. Data into T1 is getting inserted but no insertion is happening in T2( which I think should happen automatically here) ?
Please tell me where I am doing things wrongly.
And, I want to learn more about Hibernate Annotations. Can anyone point me to some useful online resources.</p>

<p>And, is it good to separate a form bean from entity class?
Please tell me the resources where I can get to learn about</p>

<pre><code>git.exe clone  --progress -v  ""ssh://user@git.mydomain.com/repos/myproj.git"" ""C:\repos\myproj""

Cloning into C:\repos\myproj...
fatal: 'repos/myproj.git' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
</code></pre>

<p>It asks me for my password at user@git.mydomain.com so I know the key is working, or at least I think it is, so I'm just confused as to why I would be getting this message even though it is a git repos.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

<p>I am currently working on a model <code>foo</code>, containing a primary id and some attributes. Since a complete history of the changes of <code>foo</code> is necessary, the content of <code>foo</code> is saved in the table <code>foo_content</code>. The two tables are connected through <code>foo_content.foo_id = foo.id</code>, in Cake with a <code>foo hasMany foo_content</code>-relationship.</p>

<p>To track the versions of <code>foo</code>, <code>foo_content</code> also contains the column <code>version</code>, and <code>foo</code> itself the field <code>currentVersion</code>. The version is an number incremented by one everytime the user updates <code>foo</code>. This is an older native PHP-app btw, to be rewritten on top of Cake. 9 times out of 10 in the app, the most recent version (<code>foo.currentVersion</code>) is the db-entry that need to be represented in the frontend.</p>

<p>My question is simply: is there someway of representing this directly in the model? Or does this kind of logic simply need to be defined in the controller?</p>

<p>Most grateful for your help!</p>
