I would like to not block the UI while the file is uploading, and after some research, it looked like the new AsyncController might let me do what I'm trying to do.  Problem is - every example I have seen isn't really doing the same thing, so I seem to be missing one crucial piece.  After much futzing and fiddling, here's my current code:</p>

<pre><code>public void CreateAsync(int CompanyId, FormCollection fc)
    {
        UserProfile up = new UserRepository().GetUserProfile(User.Identity.Name);
        int companyId = CompanyId;
        // make sure we got a file..
        if (Request.Files.Count &lt; 1)
        {
            RedirectToAction(""Create"");
        }

        HttpPostedFileBase hpf = Request.Files[0] as HttpPostedFileBase;
        if (hpf.ContentLength &gt; 0)
        {
            AsyncManager.OutstandingOperations.Increment();

            BackgroundWorker worker = new BackgroundWorker();
            worker.DoWork += (o, e) =&gt;
                {
                    string fileName = hpf.FileName;
                    AsyncManager.Parameters[""recipientId""] = up.id;
                    AsyncManager.Parameters[""fileName""] = fileName;
                };
            worker.RunWorkerCompleted += (o, e) =&gt; { AsyncManager.OutstandingOperations.Decrement(); };
            worker.RunWorkerAsync();

        }

        RedirectToAction(""Uploading"");
    }

public void CreateCompleted(int recipientId, string fileName)
    {
        SystemMessage msg = new SystemMessage();
        msg.IsRead = false;
        msg.Message = ""Your file "" + fileName + "" has finished uploading."";
        msg.MessageTypeId = 1;
        msg.RecipientId = recipientId;
        msg.SendDate = DateTime.Now;
        SystemMessageRepository.AddMessage(msg);
    }

    public ActionResult Uploading()
    {
        return View();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Now the idea here is to have the user submit the file, call the background process which will do a bunch of things (for testing purposes is just pulling the filename for now), while directing them to the Uploading view which simply says ""your file is uploading...carry on and we'll notify you when it's ready"".  The CreateCompleted method is handling that notification by inserting a message into the users's message queue.  </p>

<p>So the problem is, I never get the Uploading view.  Instead I get a blank Create view.  I can't figure out why.  Is it because the CreateCompleted method is getting called which shows the Create view?  Why would it do that if it's returning void?  I just want it to execute silently in the background, insert a message and stop.  </p>

<p>So is this the right approach to take at ALL?  my whole reason for doing it is with some network speeds, it can take 30 minutes to upload a file and in its current version, it blocks the entire application until it's complete.  I'd rather not use something like a popup window if I can avoid it, since that gets into a bunch of support issues with popup-blocking scripts, etc.  </p>

<p>Anyway - I am out of ideas.  Suggestions?  Help?  Alternate methods I might consider?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

I want to <strong>turn off MyLocationOverlay auto-recenter feature</strong> (to current user location) every time device location changes (and user location goes out of the visible part or the map).</p>

<p>It seems there is no flag to turn off the undesired maps auto-center feature when user location goes out of the screen </p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>public class LocationTest extends MapActivity{

  private MapView map;
  private MapController controller;

  public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.main);
    map = (MapView) findViewById(R.id.map);
    final MyLocationOverlayUpdate overlay = new MyLocationOverlayUpdate(this, map);
    overlay.enableMyLocation();
    map.getOverlays().add(overlay);
  }

  @Override
  protected boolean isRouteDisplayed() {
    return false;
  }
}

public class MyLocationOverlayUpdate extends MyLocationOverlay {

  public MyLocationOverlayUpdate(Context context, MapView mapView) {
    super(context, mapView);
  }

  public void drawMyLocation(Canvas canvas, MapView mapView, 
              Location location, GeoPoint geoPoint, long when) {}
}
</code></pre>

<p>I looked through the net for this problem but didn't found the solution provided.</p>

<p><em>Additional info found:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>I guess that documentation is faulty, buggy, or just outdated saying:</p>

<p>Optionally, the constructor can also take a MapController and use it to keep 
the ""my location"" dot visible by panning the map when it would go offscreen</p></li>
</ul>

<p>because there is no constructor accepting MapController as an argument, and it seems that I have no choice over <code>keeping the ""my location"" dot visible</code> or not.</p>

<ul>
<li>I accidentaly <strong>found a workaround</strong> by overriding method drawMyLocation() with no call to super.drawMyLocation() solves the problem of recentering the map (undesired ""feature"" turns off). However i have to reimplement drawMyLocation() method, therefore changing default appearence (and spending time...)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Maybe there is a more clear solution?</em></p>

For example, when you open your browser, and tap the search box, a keyboard prompt pops up (on top of a listview). However, notice that you can still scroll up and down on the listview without the keyboard going away. Like:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZOE0Q.png"" alt=""example showing keyboard overlaying the listview""></p>

<p>would someone please explain (preferrably some sample code in addition) how this works? </p>

<p>What i'm trying to do is just have a custom listview that always has a floating navigation bar on top of the listview and also on the bottom of the list view (it's not actually a header/footer of the listview, it's more like a header/footer of the screen). It would be similar to the example i just described, where the user can interact with both the navigation bar as well as the listview ""underneath"" the nav bar.</p>

It is a simple app that just sends a message in text form from one iDevice to another.  Originally, this app had about 6 warnings but I fixed all but two.  They are the same but deal with different delegates.  One is for the GKPeerPickerControllerDelegate and the other for the GKSessionDelegate.  Say the Picker error is for the GKPeerPickerController named picker, when you type (more complete example to follow):</p>

<pre><code>picker.delegate = self;
</code></pre>

<p>the compiler says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Passing '*const___strong' to parameter of incompatible type 'id'.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the GKSession named session, typing </p>

<pre><code>session.delegate = self;
</code></pre>

<p>makes the compiler say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sending '*const___strong' to parameter of incompatible type 'id'. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>These only pop in the button to send and peerPickerController.  I know that these warnings do not impede on the app's ability to function but I would like to completely update this for Xcode 4.2.  This app was originally written for Xcode back when iOS 3.0 was new.  Yes, I am a bit picky when it comes to writing or practicing code, it must not contain any errors/warnings whenever possible.</p>

<p>These are the code blocks where the warning occur:</p>

<pre><code>-(IBAction)btnConnect:(id)sender{
    picker = [[GKPeerPickerController alloc] init];
    picker.delegate = self;  //Warning here
    picker.connectionTypesMask = GKPeerPickerConnectionTypeNearby;

    [connect setHidden:YES];
    [disconnect setHidden:NO];
    [picker show];
}

-(void)peerPickerController:(GKPeerPickerController *)PCpicker didConnectPeer:(NSString *)peerID toSession:(GKSession *)session{
    self.currentSession = session;
    session.delegate = self;  //Warning here
    [session setDataReceiveHandler:self withContext:nil];
    PCpicker.delegate = nil;

    [PCpicker dismiss];
}

<p>The header has this:</p>

<pre><code>    @interface BTViewController : UIViewController{

"8732710","1","8732803","","2012-01-04 19:22:10","","41","70688","<p>This isn't a matter of me being stuck, but rather I'm looking for a tidy way to write my code.</p>

<p>Essentially, I'm writing an event driven application. The user triggers an event, the event gets sent to the appropriate objects, and the objects handle the events. Now I'm working on writing the even handler methods, and I was hoping to use switch statements to determine how to handle the event. Right now whilst I'm working on the general structure, the event class is really simple:</p>

<pre><code>public class Event {

    public static enum Action {
        MOVE, FOO, BAR
    }

    private Action action;
    private int duration;

    public Event(Action action, int duration) {
        this.action = action;
        this.duration = duration;
    }

    public Action getAction() {
        return action;
    }

    public int getDuration() {
        return duration;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Then, in another class, I'll have something like:</p>

<pre><code>public void handleEvent(Event evt) {    
    switch(Event.getAction()) {
        case MOVE: doSomething(); break;
        case FOO:  doSomething(); break;
        case BAR:  doSomething(); break;
        default: break; 
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>What I would <em>like</em> to do is something like this (though I would of course stick the switch statements into their own functions to avoid it turning into a nasty hairball of switches and cases):</p>

<pre><code>public void handleEvent(Event evt) {    
    switch(Event.getAction()) {
        case MOVE: switch(Event.getAction()) {
                       case UP:    break;
                       case DOWN:  break;
                       case LEFT:  break;
                       case RIGHT: break;
                   }
        case FOO:  break;
        case BAR:  break;
        default:   break; 
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, I'd want to create nested enums... like so:</p>

<pre><code>public static enum Action {
    public enum MOVE {UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT}, FOO, BAR
}
</code></pre>

<p>It's not like I can't avoid the scenario, it would just be... convenient. So whilst the above doesn't actually work, is there some similar method to achieve this? It would be nice if I could send an event with the action ""MOVE.UP"", and the method would identify it first as an action of type MOVE, and then further identify that it is specifically in the UP direction. That's just a simple example, it would be grat if I could also make longer chains, something like ""DELETE.PAGE1.PARAGRAPH2.SENTENCE2.WORD11.LETTER3"". The way I see it, I'm just going to have to use Strings and lots of if/else statements. Hoping there's a better way! (Oh, and performance matters in my case, if that helps)</p>

<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/581715/binding-to-a-command-in-a-datagrid"">Final solution found in another post</a></p>

<p>Although I appreciated the clarification that was provided, the ultimate solution was in-fact provided by another solution as linked above.  No matter WHAT I tried, the binding via the ""Element Name"" component was not working.  I had to go based on the ""Relative"" hierarchy up the datagrid...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Button Name=""btnPrintReport"" 
   Command=""{Binding DataContext.MyPrintCommand, 
             RelativeSource={RelativeSource FindAncestor, 
                             AncestorType={x:Type DataGrid}}}""
   CommandParameter=""{Binding}""
   Height=""16"" Width=""16"" HorizontalAlignment=""Center"" &gt;
   &lt;Image Source=""MyButtonImage.png"" IsHitTestVisible=""True""/&gt;
&lt;/Button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Hope something not too complicated in WPF / MVVM environment.  Here's the scenario.</p>

<p>I have a Window (.xaml) and a corresponding View Model (.cs).  The form displays fine with all the data bindings no problem. (note: this is NOT done via any commercial ""framework"" )</p>

<p>One of the controls that is in the view window is a custom user control of a datagrid with all pre-defined columns, headings and content to be displayed when the view is shown.  This works all no problem even though the control is not directly ""defined"" in the main window .xaml file, but just dropped on the form as the user control itself (which has its own obvious .cs code-behind).</p>

<p>With the main window's ""DataContext"" pointing to the View Model, and the user control that has a datagrid</p>

<pre><code>&lt;DataGrid AutoGenerateColumns=""False"" 
    Name=""dataMyStuff""
    ItemsSource=""{Binding Path=MyTablePropertyOnViewModel, 
        NotifyOnSourceUpdated=True, 
        NotifyOnTargetUpdated=True}"" ... /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, what I'm looking for.  On this data grid, I have a column that has an image in the first column.  When I click on this image, I want to print a report specific to the record as represented by this row (it has a PK value I use).  So, how do I tell the image ""KeyUp"" event to go to the View Model event handler since that is where the data is, and some other methods I'll need for preparing the call to the report.  The view portion of the grid is for cosmetic display to the user, and thus no ""functionality"" directly in this control.</p>

<p><strong>-- EDIT -- per progress from answers</strong></p>

<p>I've adjusted my datagrid per comments from Josh and Rachel, however, something still does not appear to be quite right...  Seeing the button was using a ""Command"" instance, I interpreted this as it needed to attach to an instance of an ""ICommand"" interface object on my view model.  So, I created an instance.  I know the command handler works as it is also used for common things like Add, Edit, Save, Cancel, Exit, etc...  So I have a new one for this printing purpose.  For simplicity, I have it created as an Always Execute, so there is no method to handle the ""CanExecute"" portion of the control.    I've set the button's ""Command"" to almost all iterations I could think of an still nothing, but here's an update of what I'm seeing going on.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;UserControl&gt;
   &lt;Data grid columns / template, etc to the button&gt;
      &lt;DataTemplate&gt; 
         &lt;Button Name=""btnPrintReport"" 
            Command=""{Binding DataContext.MyPrintCommand}"" &gt;
            &lt;Image Source=""myPrintImage.png""/&gt;
         &lt;/Button&gt;
      &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
   &lt;/Data grid columns, etc&gt;
&lt;/UserControl&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In my ViewModel class (myICommandButtonHandler inherits from ICommand)</p>

<pre><code>private myICommandButtonHandler myPrintCommand;
public myICommandButtonHandler MyPrintCommand
{
   get { if (myPrintCommand == null)
            myPrintCommand = new myICommandButtonHandler(myPrint);
         return myPrintCommand;
       }
}

private void myPrint()
{
   MessageBox.Show( ""Doing the print job..."" );
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, what I'm seeing.  During step through initialization of all the controls and such.  I click menu item to call my Window to be displayed.  FIRST, it creates an instance of the View Model controller.  THEN, it calls the Window and passes in the View Model controller as parameter so it is immediately set at the Window level as the ""DataContext"" of the window.  The main window then goes into it's ""InitializeComponents"" call and starts to build out all the other controls embedded, including this separate class that contains the data grid in question.  At the constructor of this usercontrol (that has the datagrid), there is no ""data context"" set yet as the rest of the controls have not been initialized yet, and I don't know  why / when the ""bindings"" apparently get ""hooked"" in.  So, it appears that trying to do the binding to the data grid's command button are failing. HOWEVER, at run-time, the actual data IS updated in the grid, so I know that much is working.</p>

<p>So, the data grid has its ""ItemsSource"" set to a property of a ""DataView"" property on the view model, but the binding of the ""button"" doesn't appear to see the ""MyPrintCommand"" handler that I thought would get the hit.. and its action is to just display a message box (for now).</p>

<p>The line cuts out the UTF-8 middot, it doesn't replace it, and it does that only half the time. The other half the time it misses the character, and leaves it unchanged. If I make multiple copies of it or move other lines around it, it doesn't even do that.</p>

<p>This feels like a multithreading issue, but I'm not aware of any multithreading going on. Just a block of replaceAlls in a included .jsp file being run from another .jsp.</p>

<p>What could cause this race-condition like behavior?</p>

<p>I was wondering if someone could tell me what the correct way to call the ReportsController->create() method from my form would be. The only idea I can come up with would be to have form have a random action, something like <code>action=""application/views/reports/new.php""</code> and call my controllers create method from there. The problem is, that defeats the purpose of the <code>__autoload</code> function, unless I am mistaken.</p>

I'm guessing most people's answers for the time being is that they're not, but I hope that eventually non-MAS apps could be sandboxed just like MAS apps.</p>

<p>To use Sparkle, your app would need network access, which could be granted, as well as the ability to overwrite itself in Applications. Currently you could do this with the com.apple.security.temporary-exception.files.absolute-path.read-write entitlement, but that's not a good solution. It will likely go away, and even if it doesn't there's little point in sandboxing an app if you're going to give it full filesystem read-write access as well as network access.</p>

<p>Has anyone already gone down this path and found a good solution? I ask because I try to keep my MAS build and my non-MAS build as identical as possible, and I'm currently looking at having my MAS build sandboxed and my non-MAS build not.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a module or namespace declaration group <code>F</code> is opened, items are added to the name environment as follows:</p>

<p>To put my question in context, imagine the following</p>

<ol>
<li><p>My main application looks like a file manager. It currently sees 10 files each of about 5MB in size. (Don't worry about how this list works etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>When I select one file item, I want it to immediately start copying/duplicating the file onto another location on the SD card. Typically this should take a few seconds</p></li>
<li><p>I want to be able to select a second, or a third etc. file immediately after the first. At the end of everything, all the files which I selected will be duplicated. So I could, for example click 5 files within 5 seconds, but all the copying actions takes a minute.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>At this moment two options have come to my mind:</p>

<p>The first is to simply put the file writing commands of each file in a seperate thread. Pseudocode will look like this</p>

<pre><code>Onclick
   new Thread()
      write file
</code></pre>

<p>If this works, there can be scenarios where I have 10 threads running simultaneously, writing to 10 seperate files. I would like to know if anyone has done this before, and what I should be looking out for</p>

<p>The second option, of course, is if there is already a certain data structure/known methods that can address this problem. Some sort of a pending queue system that gets larger as I add requests, but gets smaller as the system writes the data away.</p>

<p>So small example, here is a snippet of a gwt html page:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body class='page'&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=""javascript:''"" id=""__gwt_historyFrame"" tabIndex='-1' style=""position: absolute; width: 0; height: 0; border: 0""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
        Query Terms: &lt;span id=""txtQuery""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;
        &lt;span id=""btnQuery""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And here is a small java snippet contained in the gwt entry point:</p>

<pre><code>ClickHandler clickHandler = ...
TextBox txtQuery = new TextBox();
Button btnQuery = new Button(""Query"", clickHandler);

RootPanel.get(""txtQuery"").add(txtQuery);
RootPanel.get(""btnQuery"").add(btnQuery);
</code></pre>

<p>One of the reasons I like this approach is that it allows non java coders to design / write the html stuff, and I also like the separation between GWT / java code and the html code.</p>

<p>However... this may work well for a simple web page, but how do you scale this approach up into many webpages? From what I understand, the ""GWT way"" of doing things is to have one webpage and use history to hide and show various GWT components. I have built 2 projects in GWT using this standard technique, but recently discovered that you can do the sort of thing I showed above.</p>

<p>Is there any way of scaling the above 2 snippets into multiple html pages, where GWT injects its components into standard html pages?</p>

<p>Long story short: the actions are being called via jQuery ajax, and the action params are only null if the ajax call is made while the browser is navigating to another page. IE click a link and then trigger an ajax call.</p>

<p>I added some crude validation around these calls to ensure that we aren't actually passing nulls in the ajax data, and this hasn't alleviated the problem. An example of one of the calls is below.</p>

<pre><code>    var searchValue = _txtSearch.val().trim();

    if (searchValue === null 
        || searchValue === undefined 
        || searchValue.length &lt; _minimumLengthForSearch) {
        _txtSearch.focus();
        return;
    }
    // clear out the value when launching
    _txtSearch.val('');

    $.post(_quickSearchUrl,
        { searchString: searchValue },
        function (data) {...},
    ""json"");

I was curious as to whether anyone else has encountered this phenomena before. Again, I can only reproduce this issue in IE and only during page navigation.</p>

<p>Edit: It is difficult to reproduce this exception with Fiddler active for some reason, but when I manage to Fiddler displays the following error message: </p>

"8732846","1","","","2012-01-04 19:32:34","","37","15491","<p>ECMAScript Fifth Edition (released December 2009) introduces a bunch of new methods (see <a href=""http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this table</a> for details). However, there still are older browsers out there which do not implement those new methods. </p>

<p>Luckily, there exists a convenient script (written in JavaScript) - <a href=""https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim"" rel=""noreferrer"">ES5-shim</a> - which implements those methods manually in environments where they don't exist.</p>

<p>However, I am not sure how to provide ES5-shim... Should I just ""give"" it to all browsers, like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=""es5-shim.js""&gt;&lt;/scipt&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Or should I include a check in order to only ""bother"" those browsers which really need it, like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
    if ( !Function.prototype.hasOwnProperty( 'bind' ) ) {
        (function () {
            var shim = document.createElement( 'script' );
            shim.src = 'es5-shim.js';
            var script = document.getElementsByTagName( 'script' )[0];
            script.parentNode.insertBefore( shim, script );
        }());
    }
&lt;/script&gt;

<p>(I'm using <code>Function.prototype.bind</code> to check if a browser implements all new ECMAScript 5 methods. According to the compatibility table which I linked above, <code>bind</code> is the ""last bastion"" when it comes to implementing ECMAScript 5 methods.)</p>

<p>Of course, for this shim to be effective, it has to be executed <em>before</em> all other scripts, which means that we want to include the above mentioned SCRIPT elements early in the page (in the HEAD, before all other SCRIPT elements).</p>

<p>So, would this second example be a good way to provide ECMAScript 5-shim to browsers? Is there a better way to do it?</p>

<p>However, when trying a remote install with the server deployed on IIS and the client being launched from an other PC, my channel Open method fails with the following exception :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The X.509 certificate CN=MyOwnCertificate chain building failed. The certificate that was used has a trust chain that cannot be verified. Replace the certificate or change the certificateValidationMode. </p>

<p>(MyOwnCertificate being a self-signed certificate using makecert; the certificate has been inserted in Trusted Root Certification Authorities).</p>

<p>So I first tried to remove this constraint by the following code, for test purposes :</p>

<pre><code>this.ClientCredentials.ServiceCertificate.Authentication.CertificateValidationMode = X509CertificateValidationMode.PeerOrChainTrust; 
        this.ClientCredentials.ServiceCertificate.Authentication.RevocationMode = X509RevocationMode.NoCheck;

<p>(sorry for the french message).</p>

<p>Is there a way to make self-signed certificates work in such a remote scenario ? (which I would prefer since I only need the certificate for internal use)</p>

<p>Would it work with a certificate generated with openssl (http://www.freebsdmadeeasy.com/tutorials/freebsd/create-a-ca-with-openssl.php) ?</p>

<p>Your help will be most welcome. Thanks.</p>

<p>EDIT 06/01/2012 : Also tested with a signed certificate as suggested (+ revocation list), works in local but fails in remote. Certs have been defined as explained <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms733813.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. I have the CA certificate deployed under Trusted Root. The IP and Server certificates are deployed in MY (with pfx) and Trusted People (with cer). Also IIS has been setup so that the NETWORK account can access private keys deployed under LOCALMACHINE MY.  </p>

<p>EDIT 07/01/2012 : It works when the certificate is issued by an official CA (i.e verisign, thawte ...)</p>

Here is the XML file and the code I have so far.</p>

<pre><code>library(XML)
url='http://ClinicalTrials.gov/show/NCT00001400?displayxml=true'  
doc = xmlParse(url,useInternalNode=TRUE)
</code></pre>

<p>I was able to use some functions within the XML package with sucess(e.g., getNodeSet), but I am not an expert and there are some examples on the internet but I was not able to crack this problem myself. I also know some XPath but this was 4 years ago and I am not an expert on sapply and similar functions.</p>

<p>But my goal is this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I need to remove a whole set of XML children branches about location, for example: <code>&lt;location&gt;  ... anything &lt;/location&gt;</code>.  There can be multiple nodes with location data. I simply don't need that detail in the output.  The XML file above always complies to an XSD schema. The root node is called <code>&lt;clinical_study&gt;</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The resulted simplified file should be written into a new XML file called ""data-changed.xml"".</p></li>
<li><p>I also need to rename and move one branch from old nested place of </p>

<p><code>&lt;eligibility&gt;
   &lt;criteria&gt;
     &lt;textblock&gt;
       Inclusion criteria are xyz
     &lt;/textblock/&gt;...</code></p></li>
<li><p>In new output (""data-changed.xml"") the structure should say a different XML node and be directly under root node: </p>

<p><code>&lt;eligibility_criteria&gt; 
   Inclusion criteria are xyz
&lt;/eligibility_criteria&gt;</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>So I need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>read the XML into memory</li>
<li>manipulate the tree (prune it somewhere)</li>
<li>move some XML nodes to a new place and under a new name and </li>
<li>write the resulting XML output file. </li>
</ul>

<p>Any ideas are greatly appreciated?</p>

<p>Also, if you know about a nice (recent !) tutorial on XML parsing within R (or book chapter which tackles it, please share the reference). (I read the vignettes by Duncan and these are too advanced (too concise)). </p>

<p>Everything works perfectly using ""after"" callback provided by Cycle Plugin, but somehow I'm not able to retrieve the original .flash content, the last line of my callback function just simply does nothing and .flash is being replaced with empty div permanently:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery(""#slider"").cycle({
  after: callbackAfter,
});

function callbackAfter(){
   var FlashContent = jQuery(this).prev('.slide').find('.flash'); //find any flash content in previous slide
   var FlashContentHolder = jQuery(""&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;""); //place empty div instead
   FlashContent.replaceWith(FlashContentHolder ); //replace the flash content with empty div
   FlashContent.replaceWith(FlashContent); //This doesn't work - replace the empty div with stored flash content
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The issue is the last line that does not display original FlashContent.</strong></p>

<p>I was trying to set FlashContent &amp; FlashContentHolder variables out of the function to change scope, but that's not the point, I guess the first line is the issue, because I'm removing something then searching for it, so I'm getting nothing in return?</p>

<p>This function works and does exactly what I need (but doesn't display .flash videos in original positions, and I can't use absolute positioning):</p>

<pre><code>function callbackAfter(){
   var stopFlash = jQuery(this).prev('div').find('.flash').remove();
   jQuery(this).prev('div').append(stopFlash); 
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>This actually works with small issue (see above).</strong></p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>The accepted answerer there suggests refactoring an Expression referencing local objects into something that Linq to Entities can actually execute against the backing store (in my case SQL Server)</p>

<p>I've spent a long time trying to come up with something that will work for what I'm doing. My original</p>

<pre><code>Func&lt;Thing, bool&gt; whereClause
</code></pre>

<p>was referencing a local Dictionary object which Linq to Entities or SQL could not understand at runtime. I tried refactoring into multiple lists which faked a dictionary, and Arrays after that. Each time, I got runtime errors complaining about the context doesn't recognize things like the methods on a List, or array indexers.</p>

<p>Eventually I gave up and just provided an additional method which takes a Func argument for when I cannot come up with the proper Expression.</p>

<p>I'm not trying to find a solution to my specific problem, I'm just wondering in general if it is <em>always</em> possible to convert, say a </p>

<pre><code>Func&lt;Thing, bool&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>to an equivalent </p>

<pre><code>Expression&lt;Func&lt;Thing, bool&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which can run against Linq to Entities.
Or if there are many examples of querys where you simply <em>must</em> pull the data into memory first.</p>

<p>I have a domain object with several transient fields that contain complex POJOs. When the comain object is saved, I want to serialize these objects to XML (using Xstream), and store them into a PersistentMap in my database.</p>

<p>So i create a @PrePersist/@PreUpdate method on my domain object, and in those methods serialize the values and place them into the persistent map in the domain object. When the persist is called, I can see the values get serialized, the map gets updated, but the actual values saved are the original values, not the updated ones.</p>

<p>My assumption is that since the change is happening in the PrePersist/PreUpdate methods, the underlying persistence provider (in my case Hibernate 3) determines the changed fields in the domain prior to calling the PrePersist/PreUpdate method, and so when the actual save is done, the original values are never updated.</p>

<p>Can anyone give me a clue on how to make this work? Is there some other mechanism I can use other than the PrePersist/PreUpdate hooks?</p>

Well, everything went fine, but resolution is not satisfying me enough.
I have seen a lot of examples how people implement MC algorithm, but most of them,
as far as I understand, uses functions to triangulate final mesh, which is not 
appropriate for me.</p>

<p>I will try briefly to explain how I'm constructing my terrain, and maybe someone
of you will give me suggestion how to improve, or to increase resolution of final terrain.</p>

<h3>1) Precalculating MC triangles.</h3>

<p>I'm running simple loop through MC lookup tables for each case(0-255) and calculating triangles
   in rage: [0,0,0] - [1,1,1].
   No problems here.</p>

<h3>2) Terrain</h3>

<p>I have terrain class, which stores my voxels.
   In general, it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>int size = 32;//Size of each axis.
unsigned char *voxels = new unsigned char[(size * size * size)/8];
</code></pre>

<p>So, each axis is 32 units of size long, but, I store voxel information per bit.
   Meaning if bit is turned on (1), there is something, and there should be draw something.</p>

<p>I have couple of functions:</p>

<pre><code>TurnOn(x,y,z);
TurnOff(x,y,z);
</code></pre>

<p>to turn location of voxel on or off. (Helps to work with bits).</p>

<p>Once terrain is allocated, I'm running perlin noise, and turning bits on or off.</p>

<p>My terrain class has one more function, to extract Marching Cubes case number (0-255) from x,y,z location:</p>

<pre><code>unsigned char GetCaseNumber(x,y,z);
</code></pre>

<p>by determining if neighbours of that voxel is turned on or off.
   No problems here.</p>

<h3>3) Rendering part</h3>

<p>I'm looping for each axis, extracting case number, then getting precalculated triangles by case,
   translating to x,y,z coordinates, and drawing those triangles.
   no problems here.</p>

<p>So result looks like this: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/KtW6O.png"" alt=""terrain""></p>

<p>But as you can see, in any single location, resolution is not comparable to for example this:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EsRog.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EsRog.gif"" alt=""MC""></a><br>
<sub>(source: <a href=""http://www.angelfire.com/linux/myp/MCAdvanced/mcnormal.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">angelfire.com</a>)</sub>  </p>

<p>I have seen in MC examples that people are using something called ""iso values"", which I don't understand.
Any suggestions how to improve my work, or what is iso values, and how to implement it in uniform grid would be truly lovely.</p>

<p>Why might Cargo be looking for Tomcat's lib folder under /server/lib instead of just /lib? </p>

<p>Is there a way to override this behavior?</p>

<p><em>UPDATE:</em></p>

<p>After looking through the different versions of Tomcat (5.5, 6.0, 7.0) it looks like the directory structure for 5.5 had /server/lib and /common/lib where 6.0 and 7.0 just have /lib. </p>

<p>Cargo seems to be trying to instantiate a Tomcat 5.5 app. How do I configure it to use 6.0?</p>

This driver will pass all traffic while collecting metadata (primarily timing information). The driver will export this information to a user application by inserting its own packets containing the metadata and passing them up the stack. </p>

<p>My question is regarding NDIS versions. Eventually, I will have to write a driver for both Windows XP and 7. However at the moment, I will only be implementing one of these as a proof of concept/prototype. I know that in NDIS 6 they split the filter functionality out from generic intermediate drivers into a separate driver type (lightweight filter) in order to simplify the creation of filter drivers. Microsoft provides examples of passthrough filter drivers in the DDK for both NDIS 5 and 6. I've been looking at these examples and the NDIS 6 LWF only looks somewhat simpler (although admittedly, I'm still new to Windows driver development).</p>

<p>All other things equal, it would be better to support Win XP first (larger installed base, easier access to test machines, etc). However, if NDIS 6 lightweight filters would make for faster/easier development, I might be better off implementing the Win 7 driver first. </p>

<p>In short: In your experience has NDIS 6 noticeably simplified filter driver development compared to NDIS 5?</p>

<p>Thanks for any input.</p>

<p>I have a flat .csv file (RawData) and I'm trying to normalize this parent table into set-like child (look-up?) tables and then impose referential integrity using python2.7, sqlite3 v.3.7.7 on ubuntu 11.10.</p>

<p>I also realise that my understanding and naming conventions might also be causing problems as it would appear I'm trying to make distinct sets of people, institutions, places, etc. on the unitary side of a many-to-one relationship as children, with the exception being the relation between RawGrant and Grant, which I think should be 1-to-1.</p>

<p>I've a sneaking suspicion that there are a number of problems in my attempts and thought it might be more expedient to ask in the hopes of being cured of my ignorances.</p>

<p>Many thanks in advance,
christopher</p>

<p>Here is the previous question I was trying to follow:
<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7933166/how-to-reference-the-child-of-a-many-to-one-relationship-in-sqlalchemy"">How to reference the child of a many to one relationship in SQLAlchemy?</a></p>

<p>Here, I think, is what I'm trying to do, but am getting confused with the nomenclature btw class, table and relation:</p>

<pre><code>class Parent(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'parent'
    parent_id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)

    # use a set
    children = relationship(Child, collection_class=set)

parent = Parent()
child = Child()
parent.children.add(child)
assert child in parent.children
