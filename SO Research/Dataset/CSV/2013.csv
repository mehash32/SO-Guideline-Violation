Vector components are word weights in this document computed as TFIDF values. Next I build a model in which every class is presented by a single vector. Model has as many vectors as there classes in the corpora. Component of a model vector is computed as mean of all component values taken from vectors in this class. For unclassified vectors I determine similarity with a model vector by computing cosine between these vectors.</p>

<p>Questions: </p>

<p>1) Can I use Euclidean Distance between unclassified and model vector to compute their similarity? </p>

<p>2) Why Euclidean distance can not be used as similarity measure instead of cosine of angle between two vectors and vice versa?</p>

<pre><code>require 'mongo_mapper'
require './init/mongo_init' # Load database connection

class Sortable
    include MongoMapper::Document
    key :baz, Integer

    def self.sort_baz
        counter = 0
        Sortable.each do |record|
            record.baz = counter
            counter += 1

<p>Here's my question: I'm writing code with models that will want to inherit multiple types of functionalities, which in Ruby would suggest using Modules and includes, since Ruby doesn't support multiple inheritance. </p>

<p>But MongoMapper documents have to be classes, not modules. In other words, this is what I'd like to do, but it won't work:</p>

<pre><code>module Sortable

    def self.sort_baz
        counter = 0
        self.each do |record|
            record.baz = counter
            counter += 1
            record.save
        end
    end

<p>Sample data for the ratios:</p>

<pre><code>n=50
ratio1 &lt;- seq(0,1.5,(1.5-0)/(n-1))
ratio2 &lt;- seq(0,2.5,(2.5-0)/(n-1))
ratio3 &lt;- seq(0.5,4.5,(4.5-0.5)/(n-1))
ratio4 &lt;- seq(1,3,(3-1)/(n-1))
ratio5 &lt;- seq(0.7,2,(2-0.7)/(n-1))
</code></pre>

<p>To name the ratios: </p>

<pre><code>rname &lt;- c(""a/b"",""c/d"",""e/f"",""g/h"",""i/j"") 
</code></pre>

<p>so the y-axis labels are <code>c(a,c,e,g,i)</code> and x-axis <code>c(b,d,f,h,j)</code></p>

<p>Now, let's say the current measured values are:</p>

<pre><code>measure.r &lt;- data.frame(c(0.7,1.5,3.3,2.5,1.5))
colnames(measure.r) &lt;- C(""r1"",""r2"",""r3"",""r4"",""r5"")
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I would like to plot the measured value within each domain (ratio1, ratio2...etc.) as the referenced SO post about plotting correlation matrix.</p>

<p>So I would like to express the current measured value position within the interval in a color (from green to red, where red means the the upper limit has been reached)</p>

<p>I would like to have the 5 ratios plotted as the correlation matrix referenced here. Where each square would represent state of the measured value (via its color).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hiaXn.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Depending on what menus were assigned in this plugin I redirect the user to a specific page. This all works quite well.</p>

<p>My problem is when registration fails (ie. duplicate username, wrong matching passwords etc.) the page does a refresh due to the server side validation. This refresh brings the page away from the original link. It seem to redirect to the first registration menu page I created.</p>

<p>For example: I'm on a registration page and I enter wrong credentials then the page refreshes to a completely different page. Any ideas? I guess an extension for AJAX registration might address this but I'd like to avoid that for now.</p>

<p>I have two queries that both aggregates by date.</p>

<p>The first one returns an aggregated daily weighted return</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Records.RecDate, Sum([YTD]*[Weight]) AS UnadjReturn
FROM Records
WHERE (((Records.[Class1])=""eq"") AND ((Records.[Class2])=""ce""))
GROUP BY Records.RecDate;
</code></pre>

<p>Result:</p>

<pre><code>RecDate UnadjReturn
11/27/2012  0.060778036742704

12/14/2012  7.47574641136453E-02
</code></pre>

<p>I also have another query that returns daily total class portfolio weight by summing the weight of all the assets in an asset class with respect to the entire portfolio:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Records.RecDate, Sum(Records.Weight) AS SumOfWeight
FROM Records
WHERE (((Records.[Class1])=""eq"") AND ((Records.[Class2])=""ce""))
GROUP BY Records.RecDate;
</code></pre>

<p>which returns:</p>

<pre><code>RecDate SumOfWeight
11/27/2012  0.479327081236988

12/14/2012  0.482791727874428
</code></pre>

<p>Now I would like to write a consolidated query that multiplies each day's <code>UnadjReturn</code> by <code>SumOfWeight</code>. I have tried <code>INNER JOIN</code> the two and then multiply the two variables as follows,</p>

<pre><code>SELECT joined.RecDate, joined.UnadjReturn * joined.SumOfWeight as AdjReturn
FROM joined
(
SELECT Records.RecDate, Sum([YTD]*[Weight]) AS UnadjReturn
FROM Records
WHERE (((Records.[Class1])=""eq"") AND ((Records.[Class2])=""ce""))
GROUP BY Records.RecDate
INNER JOIN
(
SELECT Records.RecDate, Sum(Records.Weight) AS SumOfWeight
FROM Records
WHERE (((Records.[Class1])=""eq"") AND ((Records.[Class2])=""ce""))
GROUP BY Records.RecDate;
) t2
ON Records.RecDate = t2.RecDate
AS joined
)
</code></pre>

<p>This is not looking good at all. Any suggestions? I could do it by querying the two queries with another query, but I would like to take care of it in just one. </p>

Thanks</p>

The HTML output, if I assume to make pagination 2 elements per page, and considering only the 3 elements in example, the output should be</p>

Here's a quick test to demonstrate:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String... args) {

<pre><code>first trial happened
second trial was false
third trial, fun with doubles

<p>This is <em>obviously</em> correct behavior - an <code>Integer</code> is <strong>not</strong> a <code>Long</code>. However, does there exist a ""value equals"" for <code>Number</code> subclasses that would return true the same way that <code>100 == 100L</code> returns true? Or <code>100d == 100L</code>? In other words, is there a method (that is not <code>Object.equals</code>) that will do the equivalent of the Binary Numeric Promotion behavior for objects?</p>

Can anyone please explain this?</p>

   My problem is with reverse geocoding using Google Maps v3. I have found plenty of examples on the internet and have gotten the basics of my map working, however the reverse geocoding part is frustrating me in that I simply cannot get it to work. I keep on getting an error of ""object HTMLDivElement"". The part of the code that I am having trouble with is:</p>

<pre><code>  var geocoder = new google.maps.Geocoder();  

  var point = new google.maps.LatLng(38.41054600530499, -112.85153749999995);
    geocoder.geocode({ 'latLng': point }, function (results, status) {
    if (status !== google.maps.GeocoderStatus.OK) {
        alert(status);
    }
    // This is checking to see if the Geoeode Status is OK before proceeding
    if (status == google.maps.GeocoderStatus.OK) {
        console.log(results);
        var address = (results[0].formatted_address);
    }}
    )
  var marker = createMarker(point,""Marker 1"", point + ""&lt;br&gt; Closest Matching Address:"" + address)
</code></pre>

<p>The map still loads, yet the infobox reads ""38.41065600530499, -112.8515374999995; Closest Matching Address:[""object HTMLDivElement""]</p>

<p>So what is it that I need to change? I'm certain that the code listed above has something wrong with it, but what exactly?</p>

<p>Thanks for any and all help.</p>

<p>I would assume this means that application should always install to the Program Files folder, not the Program Files (x86) folder.

<p>I tried simply changing the install path from ProgramFilesFolder to ProgramFiles64Folder but this do anything unless I also made the component 64-bit and set the installer to x64. (Thus making the installer 64-bit <strong>ONLY</strong>)</p>

<p>Any idea how to make an installer never install to the (x86) folder or am I SOL?</p>

<p>I have an array of objects representing a table of data that needs to be transformed into a matrix for a visualization. I somehow avoided covering matrix math during my education, so apologies if my terminology is incorrect.</p>

<hr>

<p>More specifically, I have an array of objects representing formatted data:</p>

<pre><code>var pokes = [
    {source: ""Harry"", target: ""Maria"", type: ""poke""},
    {source: ""Brin"", target: ""Serge"", type: ""poke""},
    {source: ""Maria"", target: ""Brin"", type: ""poke""},
    {source: ""Serge"", target: ""Simon"", type: ""poke""},
    {source: ""Brin"", target: ""Serge"", type: ""poke""}
];
</code></pre>

<p>And I need to turn it into a square matrix for use with a chord diagram, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>var matrix = [
    [0, 5, 2, 1, 4],
    [7, 0, 8, 4, 7],
    [9, 4, 0, 3, 1],
    [8, 5, 5, 0, 8],
    [6, 3, 9, 2, 0]
];
</code></pre>

<p>The length/width of the resulting matrix, n, equals the number of unique individuals in the array (Harry, Serge, etc), and the value in the corresponding cell (x, y) is the number of times person x poked person y. Each object in the pokes array represents one poke (the ""type"" property doesn't affect the construction of the matrix).  </p>

<hr>

<p>So, for example, the object:</p>

<pre><code>{source: ""Brin"", target: ""Serge"", type: ""poke""}
</code></pre>

<p>would add 1 to the cell that represents (Brin, Serge).</p>

<hr>

<p>This is my pseudocode method:</p>

<pre><code>Create array, people, containing list of unique people in pokes (both source and target).
Create empty array, matrix.
For each person in people:
    Create an array, foo, of size people.length.
    For each poke in pokes:  
        If person == poke.source:
            Add 1 to foo[x] where x is the index of poke.target in people.
    Push foo into matrix.
</code></pre>

<p>I haven't progressed into real code because I am not sure that this method is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Correct</li>
<li>Efficient/fast, especially if pokes.length approaches thousands</li>
</ol>

<p>Any advice would be appreciated;  especially if d3.js has a hidden method for creating matrices that I haven't spotted.</p>

This is essentially a priority queue but has a bound on the number of elements that can be there in the queue. So, if I insert a new element and the queue is full, then I see if the element is greater than the top of the queue. If yes, then I discard the new element. If no, then I remove the top element and insert this new element (and the queue gets automatically reorganized). I have currently implemented BoundedPriorityQueue as derived from PriorityQueue having a ""maxCount"" member and I have overridden the add method and added the functionality I described above. I am wondering if I should consider doing it the composition way rather than the inheritance way. My current approach seems simple though.</p>

<p>I'm quite new to this, so this question is probably basic, and I appreciate any help that anybody can give me.</p>

<pre><code>UITapGestureRecognizer *tap = [[UITapGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(togglePopover)];

[self.view addGestureRecognizer:tap];

press.delegate = self; //set the delegate to self

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
I completely removed the embedded video tab and just tried submitting the video using the filefield, and it's still being processed as HTML.  So I've isolated that the problem doesn't have to do with the way the form is set up in tabs.  I think it might have to do with the Gem I'm using to upload video files (carrierwave-video), but I'm still not sure, so if anyone is able to shed any light, it would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p><strong>Edit1:</strong>

<p><strong>Edit2:</strong>      </p>

<p>So I have checked if my train_set and data_set contained any data and they don't. 
I've checked my image_dirs, and they contain the right locations(just for clarity, I got them by going to the actual files, looking at the properties of one the images and copied the location). The fault should lie somewhere else. </p>

<p><strong>How can I instantiate a new View or clear/unset the variables given by it's controller?</strong> </p>

<p>I appreciate the Views have a broad scope, but this seems like a bug in Codeigniter.</p>

<p><strong>Controller:</strong></p>

<pre><code>for($i=0; $i &lt; 100; $i++) {
    $test = $this-&gt;prizedistributor-&gt;isWinner();
    echo $this-&gt;load-&gt;view(""simulateResponse"", $test, TRUE);
    unset($test['winner']); // this does not work
}     
</code></pre>

<p>View:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;? if (isset($winner)):?&gt;
    WINNER!
&lt;? else: ?&gt;
    LOST!
&lt;? endif; ?&gt;
&lt;?php unset($winner); // this does not work! ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The Results:</strong></p>

<p>Say <code>$i==40</code> is the only winner, the View will report ALL $i's > 40 as winners despite the Controller always defaulting the Boolean as false. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I am aware testing if(empty($test)) allows the View to report correctly. However, my question is how to unset that variable (and clear it from memory). This question largely stems from other similar issues while using HMVC (modular codeigniter). However posting that code here would be too complicated to illustrate the same issue of scope.</p>

<hr>

<p>Many folks keep questioning irrelevant prizedistributor above. So here is a <strong>simpler code sample to illustrate the sampe problem</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>CONTROLLER</strong></p>

<pre><code>function testScope() {
    for($i=0; $i &lt; 10; $i++) {
        if($i == 5)$winner = array('winner' =&gt; true);
        else $winner = array();
        echo $this-&gt;load-&gt;view(""testScope"", $winner, TRUE);
    }        
}  
</code></pre>

<p><strong>VIEW</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?= (isset($winner))  ? ""WINNER!&lt;br&gt;"" : ""LOST!&lt;br&gt;""; ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>OUTPUT</strong></p>

<p>LOST!
LOST!
LOST!
LOST!
LOST!
WINNER!
WINNER!
WINNER!
WINNER!
WINNER!</p>

<p><strong>Possible Answer:</strong></p>

<p>I've looked into codeigniter's <code>system/core/Loader.php</code> and find function <code>_ci_load</code> caches variables around line 800. They're reasoning being: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can either set variables using the dedicated $this->load_vars()
  function or via the second parameter of this function. We'll merge the
  two types and cache them so that views that are embedded within other
  views can have access to these variables.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This brings up a very good point and something I appreciate about codeigniter. But the question remains, <strong>how can we have both?</strong> Possibly a 4th optional parameter to skip this catching? </p>

<p>ex. <code>loader-&gt;view(""testScope"", $winner, TRUE, FALSE);</code> ????</p>

<p>This is the part that I want to remove <code>wp_posts.post_author = 347</code> This is not present in the query made by admin. I have seen <code>remove_query_arg</code> in wordpree query but not sure when and how to use it and if it can be used to remove this argument in the query at all. </p>

<p>Help!!</p>

<p>The rest of the code is the GUI and what not.</p>

<p>Does anyone know what this could be? I don't remember changing anything that I know of when I was trying to fix my decimal point issue and I changed the code back to how it previously was when it last worked</p>

<p>The error says it occurs at line 190 which is <code>result.setText(result.getText() + ""1"");</code></p>

<p>Of course if I click a different button the line number will change, that is just an example if the user pressed the number 1 button</p>

I have been trying to run unit tests on the service's methods, using <code>$httpBackend</code> to mock up responses. I have not had any trouble with this when testing my controllers and directives that use <code>$http</code>, but with my service I have been having difficulty.</p>

<p>I've been following the pattern in the first answer here:
<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12084410/angularjs-testing-service-method-that-uses-http-service"">AngularJS - Testing service method that uses $http service</a></p>

<p>i.e., register an expected request with <code>$httpBackend</code>, define a response to it, call the service's method of interest, and then flush the backend mock.</p>

<p>I'm unable to get this to work unless I inject <code>$rootScope</code>, create a new scope and run a <code>$digest()</code> on it after calling my service method of interest. This is the pattern I use with testing controllers and directives that use <code>$http</code>, as the test runner will indicate there are no pending requests to flush otherwise. However, I was not expecting this requirement in a service, as <code>scope</code> does not make a great deal of sense in one to me. Additionally, the answer in the question linked above does not indicate that this is explicitly necessary.</p>

<p>After poking around in the angular source for a fairly large deal of time this morning, I determined that a promise object is made successfully for my service's <code>$http</code> request, but that the promise resolution functions registered in <code>$q.when</code>'s call to <code>nextTick()</code> never fire. Only when I add a line to digest a scope object in my servicesSpec will everything fire....</p>

<p>Is this a known issue? I am using v1.2.0rc2. Are there workarounds to uncouple testing services from scope objects?</p>

<p>For reference, here is the spec code that functions:</p>

<pre><code>describe(""widget services"", function () {

  beforeEach(module('widget.services'));

  describe(""WidgetDB"", function () {
    var service, $httpBackend, scope;
    beforeEach(inject(function ($rootScope, WidgetDB, _$httpBackend_) {
      scope = $rootScope.$new();
      service = WidgetDB;
      $httpBackend = _$httpBackend_;
    }));

    it(""should do something"", function () {
      $httpBackend.expectPOST(myUrl).respond(myResponse);
      service.getChartData(myArguments);
      scope.$digest(); // why do I need this for testing services?                                                                                                              
      $httpBackend.flush();

    });

These layers are in their own class library projects, but all in the same solution. At the lower layers, I've got the repository pattern going, with my models, repositories and dbcontext. On top of my repositories sits a service layer, which contains all of my business logic. Right now, my code for instantiating and using these various components looks like this, in my unit tests:</p>

<pre><code>using (var context = m_kernel.Get&lt;IPortalContext&gt;())
{
    var accountRepository = m_kernel.Get&lt;IAccountRepository&gt;(new ConstructorArgument(""context"", context));
    var eventRepository = m_kernel.Get&lt;IEventRepository&gt;(new ConstructorArgument(""context"", context));

    var accounts = m_kernel.Get&lt;IAccountService&gt;(new ConstructorArgument(""repository"", accountRepository));
    var events = m_kernel.Get&lt;IEventService&gt;(new ConstructorArgument(""repository"", eventRepository));

    var account = accounts.GetByUsername(""test@test.com"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>That code is very verbose, though. I can make it cleaner by creating the repository instances inside of the services, instead of outside.</p>

<p>My confusion comes while trying to do this, though. I use Ninject for my DI, and I want to create an instance of the class bound to the <code>IAccountRepository</code> interface inside of my <code>IAccountService</code> constructor. On top of that, it needs to know to use the provided <code>IPortalContext</code> as well.</p>

<p>Do I have to add Ninject as dependency to my service layer project and create a new Kernel in there and use Kernel.Get() inside for the <code>IAccountService</code> constructor? Or is there a way to tell Ninject to do this all from my unit test, for example?</p>
