<pre><code>
-(void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView willDisplayingCell:(UITableViewCell *)cell forRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
    cell.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeScale(0.8, 0.8);
    [UIView animateWithDuration:0.5 animations:^{
        cell.transform = CGAffineTransformIdentity;
    }];
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I implemented the above method in my view controller's implementation section, and ran the simulator, the result didn't look changed pre- and post-implementation.</p>

<p>So I then add <code>cell.textLabel.text = [UIColor greenColor];</code> just beneath <code>cell.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeScale(0.8, 0.8);</code> of the method above, and ran the simulator again, the screen didn't display any cells whose text is colored with green.</p>

<p>So what does this method do and when should I use it?</p>

<p>I create my template using master-detail application with core data, but even if I didn't  use core data it didn't change at all.</p>

<p>I'm on Xcode 5.0.2 and use iOS 7 simulator.</p>

<p>I need a code that strips all punctuation, EXCEPT hyphens and single apostrophes.</p>

<p>The code I've found so far is:</p>

<pre><code>import re
def textStrip():
    text = input(""Text? "")
    return re.compile('\w+').findall(text)
</code></pre>

<p>This works fantastic for stripping all punctuation, now I'm wondering if there is a way to add exceptions to this? Or if someone has a better way all together, that would help tremendously. Thanks!</p>

<p>Sample:</p>

<pre><code>""A tall-ish wall, with trim.I don't want to paint it;""
</code></pre>

<p>Would return:</p>

<pre><code>[""A"", ""tall-ish"", ""wall"", ""with"", ""trim"", ""I"", ""don't"", ""want"", ""to"", ""paint"", ""it""]

<p>The user in the game navigates around the grid by clicking on adjacent tiles, but a user has suggested using arrow keys instead.</p>

<p>My thought is just to do some simple math, and figure out which tile the user is wanting to move to based on which arrow key they hit.  So if they were on array index <code>24</code> and moved left, the new index would be <code>23</code>.</p>

<p>My question is, how do I trigger a click all the information I have provided to me is the index in the array that the user is moving to?</p>

<p>Edit: To clarify, I'm of aware trigger in jQuery, I just don't know what to pass it.  If I have 100 tiles (from 0 to 99), and I want to trigger number 23, how do I do that?</p>

    // Replace the &lt;div id=""footer""&gt; in a webpage with an &lt;img&gt; instead.

<p>So, now I need to figure out how to show and hide a DIV in the UIWebView based on if they're in a particular group or not. I have each DIV labeled with a unique ID, so I'm thinking 'getElementById' will work for identifying which DIV is which. But how do I match them up similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>if(NSArray contains thisValue) {
divID.visible =  show;
} else {
divID.visible = hide;
}

<p>One thing I'm curious about: I recall being told that I should, in general, not use HTML tables for page layout. I.e. it's fine to use them for tabulated data (its intended purpose) but not for arranging elements on a page. </p>

<p>My question is this: should the Bootstrap row and col classes be used for page layout, or exclusively for tabulated data? It seems very similar to using tables, but it also seems like they built Bootstrap with row/col being used for responsive layouts. Why are they different, if they are?</p>

We are using async.waterfall to call our functions as the result will need to be passed through from one function to the next.</p>

<p>The problem I keep running into is that of scope I believe. I'd like to emit either an 'error' or 'success' message as a part of the final callback of the waterfall, but no matter what I do, I can't seem to capture that message. The important parts of my file looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>var MetadataIngester = function() {
    var status, returnValue;
    eventEmitter.call(this);
}

util.inherits(MetadataIngester, eventEmitter);

MetadataIngester.prototype.sendEvent = function(eventType, eventMessage) {
    this.emit(eventType, eventMessage);
}

MetadataIngester.prototype.clobber = function(itemString) {
    var self = this;
    var asyncParseItem = self.parseItem;
    var asyncValidateItem = self.validateItem;
    var asyncSendvent = self.sendEvent;
    async.waterfall(
        [
            function(callback) {
                asyncParseItem(itemString, callback);
            },
           asyncValidateItem
        ],
        function(err, result) {
            if (err) {
                asyncSendEvent.call(self, 'wtf', result);
            } else {
                asyncSendEvent.call(self, 'success', {
                    'remedia_id': 123
                });
            }
        }
    );
</code></pre>

<p>To test this, I'm doing the following:</p>

<pre><code>describe(""#clobber"", function() {
    it('should emit an error event if item has not been inserted', function() {
        item = ""{}"";
        metadata.on('wtf', errorSpy);
        metadata.clobber(item);
        expect(errorSpy).to.have.been.called;
    });


});

describe(""#sendEvent"", function() {
     it('should emit an wtf event if an error event type is passed in', function() {
         metadata.on('wtf', errorSpy);
         metadata.sendEvent('wtf', {'ihateyou': 'wtf'});
         expect(errorSpy).to.have.been.called;
     });
});
</code></pre>

<p>When I run the first test, the event is emitted, but the spy is never called. However, if I call the function that emits the event directly as in the case of the second test, it works just fine, and I'm not sure why. I need to get the events captured by the test file as eventually I will be using this MetadataIngester with a queue that pulls messages off a queue and that consumer is what calls this file and expects back events so it will know what to do next.</p>

<p>Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>

The ID for these different service elements seem static, but there is nothing in the API to indicate that these are intended to be usable. In short, I am reticent to rely on them.

</code></pre>

<p>I'm stripping the port too (developing on localhost:81) because that's what <code>document.domain</code> returns.</p>

<p>Host is now simply <code>localhost</code> (haven't tried on live site yet), and I can't log in at all in IE. Works fine in Firefox, does <em>not</em> work in Chrome.</p>

<p>How can I get PHP or the browser to share session cookies between the www subdomain and no subdomain versions of the site?</p>

<hr>

<p>I tried throwing a dot in there per the related question:</p>

<pre><code>$host = $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'];
if(substr($host, 0, 4) === 'www.') $host = substr($host, 4);
$colon = strrpos($host, ':');
if($colon !== false) $host = substr($host, 0, $colon);
session_set_cookie_params(0, '/', '.'.$host);
session_start();
</code></pre>

<p>I dumped <code>session_get_cookie_params()</code> to confirm it was set correctly. This does not appear to solve my issue either. The session keeps getting reset.</p>

<p>Found a workaround for the problem. Not 100% What I was looking for though</p>

<p><strong>C++</strong></p>

<pre><code>extern ""C"" __declspec(dllexport) int* cropImage(char* path, int&amp; size)
{
    Mat matA = pavObj.cropped_liquid_region(path);

    int rows = matA.rows;
    int cols = matA.cols;
    int channels = matA.channels();

    int length = rows*cols*channels + 3;
    size = length;
    int* arr = new int[length];

    arr[0] = rows;
    arr[1] = cols;
    arr[2] = channels;

    Mat layer[3];
    split(matA, layer); // split into color layers BGR
    int count = 3;

    for(int i=0;i&lt;3;i++){
        for(int j=0;j&lt;layer[i].rows;j++){
            for(int k=0;k&lt;layer[i].cols;k++){
                arr[count] = layer[i].at&lt;uchar&gt;(j, k);
                count++;
            }
        }
    }

    return arr; 
}

extern ""C"" __declspec(dllexport) int ReleaseMemory(int* pArray)
{
    delete[] pArray;
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>VB Signatures</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;DllImport(""mat.dll"", CallingConvention:=CallingConvention.Cdecl)&gt; _
Public Shared Function cropImage(ByVal path As String, ByRef sz As Integer) As IntPtr
End Function

&lt;DllImport(""mat.dll"", CallingConvention:=CallingConvention.Cdecl)&gt; _
Public Shared Function ReleaseMemory(ByVal ptr As IntPtr) As Integer
End Function
</code></pre>

<p><strong>VB call to dll</strong></p>

<pre><code>Dim size As Integer
Dim ptr As IntPtr = cropImage(path, size)
Dim result(size) As Integer
Marshal.Copy(ptr, result, 0, size)
ReleaseMemory(ptr)
</code></pre>

<p>So what basically happens is that the content of the image is taken to a 1D array and passed to the managed side where the image is reconstructed again.</p>

<pre><code>InputStream inputStream = context.getResources().openRawResource(resourceID);

BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream));

String line;

while((line = reader.readLine()) != null)
{
    if(line.startsWith(""v ""))
    {
        Float x = Float.valueOf(line.split("" "")[1]);
        Float y = Float.valueOf(line.split("" "")[2]);
        Float z = Float.valueOf(line.split("" "")[3]);
        verticesArrayList.add(x);
        verticesArrayList.add(y);
        verticesArrayList.add(z);
    }
    else if(line.startsWith(""vn ""))
    {
        Float x = Float.valueOf(line.split("" "")[1]);
        Float y = Float.valueOf(line.split("" "")[2]);
        Float z = Float.valueOf(line.split("" "")[3]);
        normalsArrayList.add(x);
        normalsArrayList.add(y);
        normalsArrayList.add(z);
    }
    else if(line.startsWith(""f ""))
    {
        // Loop 3 times for the 3 vertices/textures/normals associated with each face
        for(int i = 1; i &lt;= 3; i++)
        {
            Short vertex = (short) (Short.valueOf(line.split("" "")[i].split(""/"")[0]) - 1);
            indicesArrayList.add(vertex);

            // Make a copy of my normals array list
            if(normalsArrayList2.size() == 0)
                normalsArrayList2 = new ArrayList&lt;Float&gt;(normalsArrayList);

            // Attempt to re-arrange the normals to match the order of the vertices
            int normal = Integer.valueOf(line.split("" "")[i].split(""/"")[2]) - 1;
            normalsArrayList2.add(vertex * 3, normalsArrayList.get(normal * 3));
            normalsArrayList2.add((vertex * 3) + 1, normalsArrayList.get((normal * 3) + 1));
            normalsArrayList2.add((vertex * 3) + 2, normalsArrayList.get((normal * 3) + 2));
        }
    }
}
reader.close();
</code></pre>

<p>However, I'm not sure if I'm setting my normals correctly.  You see what I'm doing there at the bottom of my code?  I'm trying to re-arrange the normals so that they match the order of the vertices.  I'm doing this because I'm using the GLES20.glDrawElements() method like so:</p>

<pre><code>// Get handle to vertex shader's aPosition member, enable the handle, and prepare the vertex data
mPositionHandle = GLES20.glGetAttribLocation(mProgram, ""aPosition"");
GLES20.glEnableVertexAttribArray(mPositionHandle);
GLES20.glVertexAttribPointer(mPositionHandle, COORDINATES_PER_VERTEX, GLES20.GL_FLOAT, false, VERTEX_STRIDE, verticesBuffer);

// Get handle to vertex shader's aNormal member, enable the handle, and prepare the vertex data
mNormalHandle = GLES20.glGetAttribLocation(mProgram, ""aNormal"");
GLES20.glEnableVertexAttribArray(mNormalHandle);
GLES20.glVertexAttribPointer(mNormalHandle, COORDINATES_PER_VERTEX, GLES20.GL_FLOAT, false, VERTEX_STRIDE, normalsBuffer);

// Draw the cube
GLES20.glDrawElements(GLES20.GL_TRIANGLES, numberOfIndices, GLES20.GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, indicesBuffer);
</code></pre>

<p>I got the idea for this re-arranging from this <a href=""http://aresio.blogspot.com/2009/07/wavefront-obj-files-vertex-buffer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">site</a>, after countless hours of Googling this subject.</p>

<p>However, something isn't going right.  The lighting in my shader works for all the shapes I created manually with OpenGL, just not for the models I read in using my OBJ parser, so I don't think my lighting calculations are the problem, just how the normals are being calculated in my OBJ parser.  Also, I opened my test OBJ files with Maya and used the ""Vertex Normal Edit Tool"" to visually verify that all of the normals are pointing the right way. Are there any glaring problems you can see with any of my code?</p>

<p>I have a table called 'TotalTime' which is set to INT and holds the time in seconds only. I want to convert these seconds to days, hours, minutes, seconds e.g. 01d 09:26:43.</p>

<p>Now I will show you the code I am using:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT [BuildID],[Product],[Program],


SUM(CASE WHEN [State] = 'Running' THEN cast(TotalTime as INT) ELSE 0 END) AS [Running],
SUM(CASE WHEN [State] = 'Break' THEN cast(TotalTime as INT) ELSE 0 END) AS [Break]


FROM [line_log].[dbo].[Line1Log]

GROUP BY [BuildID], [Product], [Program]
</code></pre>

<p>So as you can see I am grouping the [State] column and would like to display the results of 'TotalTime' in the format I mentioned above.</p>

<p>Now I have tried this code but it will not work as I cannot convert INT to VARCHAR</p>

<pre><code>SELECT [BuildID],[Product],[Program],

SUM(CASE WHEN [State] = 'Running' THEN CAST(FLOOR(TotalTime / 86400) AS VARCHAR(10))+'d ' + CONVERT(VARCHAR(5), DATEADD(SECOND, TotalTime, '19000101'), 8) ELSE 0 END) AS [Running]

FROM [line_log].[dbo].[Line1Log]

GROUP BY [BuildID], [Product], [Program]
</code></pre>

<p>The above would not display it in the exact format I wanted either.</p>

<p>Just wondering if someone would be willing to help me on this one?</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this :)</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>How do I get back the Smalltalk representation for an arbitrary JSON object (containing JavaScript Arrays and Objects, OrderedCollections and HashedCollections, Dictionaries in Smalltalk)?</p>

<h2>Note</h2>

<p><a href=""http://www.json.org"">http://www.json.org</a></p>

<p>JSON is built on two structures:</p>

<ul>
<li>A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object,  dictionary, hash table,  or associative array.</li>
<li>An ordered list of values. In many languages, this is realized as an array, list, or sequence.</li>
</ul>
