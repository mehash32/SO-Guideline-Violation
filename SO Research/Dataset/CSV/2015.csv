<p>I have done the following thus far:</p>

<ol>
<li>Enabled TCP/IP for SQLEXPRESS</li>
<li>Allowed port 1433 tcp on my firewall</li>
<li>Allowed port 1434 udp on my firewall</li>
<li>Enabled SQLEXPRESS server to allow remote connections</li>
</ol>

<p>I was hoping to be able to connect to the database by opening sql management studio on the other pcs and using the following format [ExternalIP]\SQLEXPRESS but as of yet I have been unable to do so. I have looked at what my external IP might be and i am getting two different values:</p>

<p>86.XX.X.XXX
66.XXX.XX.XX</p>

<p>Should I be using either of these values with this format to connect from the other sql management studios when everything has been correctly configured? Are there any steps that I am missing?</p>

When I implement the timeoffset in my code it dos not offset the time as it does in apples code it simply just starts from the beginning of my animation no matter what I do. </p>

<p>What is the difference between what apple has done an what i have done?</p>

<p>here is a snippet of apples code:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)extractAnimationsFromSceneSource:(SCNSceneSource *)sceneSource
{


// In this scene objects are animated separately using long animations
// playing 3 successive animations. We will group these long animations
// and then split the group in 3 different animation groups.
// We could also have used three DAEs (one per animation).

NSArray *animationIDs = [sceneSource identifiersOfEntriesWithClass:[CAAnimation class]];

NSUInteger animationCount = [animationIDs count];
NSMutableArray *longAnimations = [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithCapacity:animationCount];

CFTimeInterval maxDuration = 0;

for (NSInteger index = 0; index &lt; animationCount; index++) {
    CAAnimation *animation = [sceneSource entryWithIdentifier:animationIDs[index] withClass:[CAAnimation class]];
    if (animation) {
        maxDuration = MAX(maxDuration, animation.duration);
        [longAnimations addObject:animation];
     //   NSLog(@""%@"",[longAnimations description]);
    }
}

CAAnimationGroup *longAnimationsGroup = [[CAAnimationGroup alloc] init];
longAnimationsGroup.animations = longAnimations;
longAnimationsGroup.duration = maxDuration;

CAAnimationGroup *idleAnimationGroup = [longAnimationsGroup copy];
idleAnimationGroup.timeOffset = 6.45833333333333;
_idleAnimationGroup = [CAAnimationGroup animation];
_idleAnimationGroup.animations = @[idleAnimationGroup];
_idleAnimationGroup.duration = 24.71 - 6.45833333333333;
_idleAnimationGroup.repeatCount = FLT_MAX;
_idleAnimationGroup.autoreverses = YES;
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>and here is my code in swift:</p>

<p>init the animation in the class :</p>

<pre><code>class myViewController: UIViewController,
var _idleAnimationGroup = CAAnimationGroup()

...

  func extractAnimationsFromSceneSource(sceneSource: SCNSceneSource)

    {

    var animationsIDs = sceneSource.identifiersOfEntriesWithClass(CAAnimation.self) as [String]

    var animationCount = animationsIDs.count

    var longAnimations:[CAAnimation] = []
    var maxDuration : CFTimeInterval = 0;

    for animationID in animationsIDs {
        if let animation = sceneSource.entryWithIdentifier(animationID, withClass: CAAnimation.self) as? CAAnimation {
            var maxDuration = max(maxDuration, animation.duration);
          longAnimations.append(animation)
        }

    }

        var longAnimationsGroup = CAAnimationGroup()
        longAnimationsGroup.animations = longAnimations
        longAnimationsGroup.duration = maxDuration

        var idleAnimationGroup :CAAnimationGroup = longAnimationsGroup.copy() as CAAnimationGroup

        idleAnimationGroup.timeOffset = 2.5

        _idleAnimationGroup.animations = [idleAnimationGroup]
        _idleAnimationGroup.duration = 1.0


}
</code></pre>

<p>No matter how I chnage the timeoffset it always starts at 0. I see that apple has copied an animation group with a time offset and then used that to instantiate a new animation group based on that offset. I have tried to do this in my code as you can see but it does not change anything!!</p>

<p>Al I can thinkof at the moment is that the timeoffset property is not supported by iOS?? maybe its only supported by cocoa??</p>

<p>Thanks for any help you can offer!</p>

<pre><code>invalid salt (BCrypt::Errors::InvalidSalt)
</code></pre>

<p>I didn't find any upgrade notice helping me to understand the problem. I'm using Rails 4.1.8 and Sorcery 0.8.6.</p>

<p>Anybody else having this problem?</p>

<p>MORE Details:</p>

<p>I'm using Sorcery and not Devise. The encrypted data is the password.
It all started in Cucumber tests, in 2 cases:
When I used to send the @user to the mailer to prepare the data for the mails. Here was the code:</p>

<p>UserMailer.passphrase_reset_notification(@user).deliver</p>

<p>Which generated the exception with the message I wrote in the initial message. As a workaround instead of sending the @user I sent the fields I needed and it worked. Here's the new code:</p>

<p>UserMailer.passphrase_reset_notification(@user.name, @user.email).deliver</p>

<p>But the second case is the sign up. It failed in dev and I had to add :salt to user_params to fix it. But it does not fix the thing in the test env. </p>

<p>There's no stack trace, just that one liner message with the lines of my scenario leading to the error. </p>

<p>And I press ""Sign up""
      invalid salt (BCrypt::Errors::InvalidSalt)
      ./app/controllers/users_controller.rb:66:in <code>block in create'
      ./app/controllers/users_controller.rb:64:in</code>create'
      ./app/controllers/application_controller.rb:120:in <code>scope_current_tenant'

      features/users/sign_up.feature:149:in `And I press ""Sign up""'</p>

<p>I removed the ""null: false"" for the field ""salt"" in the user table, as suggested by a community member in a post on a more or less similar issue, it didn't help either. </p>

<p>My main question is still the same: what the Ruby new version (2.2.0) has to do with this? And what might be the other surprises if I upgrade the prod?</p>

<p>It's a production server. There is currently no DEV environment (this is another matter). </p>

<p>I'm forced to make a requested emergency bug fix to the live site. BUT any modification to .py files are not reflected on the site. I can even delete a view.py (and view.pyc) entirely and the page merrily continues to load. I have looked into caching (<a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/topics/cache/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/topics/cache/</a>), and have added the appropriate dummycache line:</p>

    'default': {
        'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.dummy.DummyCache',
    }
}

<pre><code>CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_KEY_PREFIX = ''
CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_SECONDS = 1
CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_ALIAS = 'default'
</code></pre>

<p>Restarting nginx service does not help. I can run <code>/etc/init.d/nginx restart</code> and original files are still running after changes or being deleted completely. The only thing which forces the new files to be read and re-compiled to pyc is restarting the entire VPS instance! I can edit templates just fine and changes are reflected asap, its only py files not compiling to pyc.</p>

<p>Some other points:</p>

<ol>
<li>I've also tried <code>sudo /etc/init.d/nginx reload</code>, no dice.</li>
<li>This is an AWS EC2 linux VPS its running python via nginx not apache</li>
<li>I've tried <code>touch &lt;project&gt;/wsgi.py</code></li>
<li>Distro is CentOS release 6.5 (Final), so i've also tried <code>sudo service nginx reload</code> and <code>sudo service nginx restart</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Is anyone please able to shed some light on this?</p>

<p>Edit: as a test, I've just deleted a critical view.py + view.pyc file to a sub section of the site, after 15 minutes, it is still running perfectly.</p>

<p>Edit2: i'm starting to think I'm simply meant to restart nginx in a different way. What should I be calling? <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25335912/saving-changes-to-django-with-nginx?rq=1"">Saving Changes To Django with Nginx?</a></p>

<p>Edit3: Based on IgnacioVazquez-Abrams help below, found that it was using uwsgi via ps -ef processes. I then found that it was using supervisor as a manager and all appropriate conf files looked fine. Then simply had to restart supervisor and BAM files updated instantly. Needless to say, this was stretching my knowledge of linux + python.</p>

Problem is it is controlled by signals so I must call app.exec() otherwise listening will not emit any signal. This is my main.cpp:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;QtGui/QApplication&gt;
#include ""receiver.h""

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
QApplication app(argc, argv);
int port = 5555;
Receiver rec;
rec.startListening(port);
for(int i = 0; i &lt; 5000; i++)
{
    QByteArray ba;
    ba = ""Hello"";
    rec.send(ba, QHostAddress::LocalHost, port);
    ba = rec.getLastMsg();
    QTextStream(stdout) &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; "":"" &lt;&lt; ba.data() &lt;&lt; endl;
}

return app.exec();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Well problem is the QUDPSocket start to work after app.exec() is called. It's mad. Is there a way provided by Qt to handle this without using another thread for sending UDP packets?</p>

The memory slowly increases as expected until I hit around line 40m, and then rapidly increases 1.5gb in 3-5 seconds before the process exits due to lack of memory.</p>

<p>After some investigation, I discovered that the blow-up occurs around the time when the current offset (curr_offset) is around 2b, which happens to be around my sys.maxint (2^31-1).</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do numbers greater than sys.maxint require substantially more memory to store?  If so, why?  If not, why would I be seeing this behavior?</li>
<li>What factors (e.g. which Python, which operating system) determine sys.maxint?
<ul>
<li>On my 2010 MacBook Pro using 64-bit Python, sys.maxint is 2^63-1.</li>
<li>On my Windows 7 laptop using 64-bit IronPython, sys.maxint is the smaller 2^31-1.  Same with 32-bit Python.  For various reasons, I can't get 64-bit Python on my Windows machine right now.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Is there a better way to create this list of offsets?</li>
</ul>

<p>The code in question:</p>

<pre><code>f = open('some_file', 'rb')
curr_offset = 0
offsets = []

    offsets.append(curr_offset)

<ol>
<li>Servlet <strong>unit tests</strong>: isolating servlets from other dependencies and simulating client, by providing get/post requests</li>

<p>Meanwhile I took a look at <code>HttpUnit</code>, but I didn't find a way to connect <code>Guice</code> to it: servlets can be registered in <code>ServletRunner</code>, but they are provided by class name. This means that ServletRunner will instantiate them (without injecting dependencies).</p>

<p>This sort of thing is usually done with tables - a column for each language and a row for each paragraph, verse or line. The problem, then, is that you can't highlight down one column without grabbing-in the adjacent column. Also, the markup becomes a disaster.</p>

<p>What I'd like to do is have the markup look something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""Pig-Latin""&gt;
  &lt;p id=""pl-1""&gt;Isthay isay inelay unway.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p id=""pl-2""&gt;Igpay Atinlay isay ardhay anguagelay.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id=""en-2""&gt;Translation of line two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Have the two languages in columns side by side, and use something (javascript, I imagine) to make sure that en-1 and pl-1 line up, etc...</p>

<p>Actually -- it would be even better if it was markers that didn't wrap any text: </p>

<p><code>&lt;a id=""en-1""&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This is line one....</code>

<p>What I am having difficulty doing is just what the title says. In the admin panel, which I am currently working on, I have (for instance) assigned to a paragraph tag the jquery bootstrap helper class of ""alert alert-success"" as you can see here: <code>http://i1379.photobucket.com/albums/...ps44962161.png</code>.</p>

<p>The reason why it is working in the above example is because the SQL which runs upon hitting save (inserting and updating) do not require ajax.</p>

<p>The code being executed when INSERTING and UPDATING is in a file named ""queries.php"" in the config folder. It is as follows (the error handling portion of course):</p>

<pre><code>case 'pages':

if (isset($_POST['submitted']) &amp;&amp; $_POST['submitted'] == 1) {
// POST vars    
$title = mysqli_real_escape_string($dbc, $_POST['title']);
$label = mysqli_real_escape_string($dbc, $_POST['label']);
$header = mysqli_real_escape_string($dbc, $_POST['header']);
$body = mysqli_real_escape_string($dbc, $_POST['body']);

if (isset($_POST['id']) AND $_POST['id'] != ''){

$action = ""updated"";    
// UPDATE   
$query = ""UPDATE posts SET user = $_POST[user], slug = '$_POST[slug]', title = '$title', label =     '$_POST[label]', header = '$header', body = '$body' WHERE id = $_GET[id]""; 

}else{

$action = ""added"";  
// INSERT 
$query = ""INSERT INTO posts (type, user, slug, title, label, header, body) VALUES (1, $_POST[user],  '$_POST[slug]', '$title','$label','$header','$body')"";

}

$result = mysqli_query($dbc, $query);

//Error Handling    
if ($result) {
$message = '&lt;p class = ""alert alert-success""&gt;Page was '.$action.'!&lt;/p&gt;';
}else{
$message = '&lt;p class = ""alert alert-danger""&gt;Page could not be '.$action.' because:         '.mysqli_error($dbc).'&lt;/p&gt;';
$message .= '&lt;p class = ""alert alert-warning""&gt;Query: '.$query.'&lt;/p&gt;'; 
}   
}

if (isset($_GET['id'])) {$opened = data_post($dbc, $_GET['id']);} 

break;
</code></pre>

<p>HOWEVER, I do not know how to get the $message variable to be echoed when DELETING a post. I'm using ajax so that the post immediately disappears from the list to the left.</p>

<p>Here's the Javascript:</p>

<pre><code>$("".page-delete"").on(""click"", function(){

var selected = $(this).attr(""id"");
var page_id = selected.split(""del_"").join("""");

var confirmed = confirm(""Are you sure you wanted to DELETE this page?"");

if (confirmed == true) {

$.get(""ajax/pages.php?id=""+page_id); 

$(""#page_""+page_id).remove();

};
</code></pre>

<p>...and here's the ajax:</p>

<pre><code>include '../../config/connection.php';

$id = $_GET['id'];

$query = ""DELETE FROM posts WHERE id = $id"";
$result = mysqli_query($dbc, $query);

if ($result) {
echo ""Page Deleted."";
}   else {
""There was an error...&lt;br&gt;"";
echo $query.'&lt;br&gt;';
echo mysqli_error($dbc);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's where I'm trying to spit out the message:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;!-- END col-md-3 --&gt;

&lt;div class=""col-md-9""&gt;

&lt;!--FORM--&gt; 
&lt;form role=""form"" action=""index.php?page=pages&amp;id=&lt;?php echo $opened['id']; ?&gt;"" method=""post""&gt;

<p>My question is, what if the owner of one of these callbacks becomes null, because the monster dies or the item was set to null etc. Am I holding a strong reference to the callback owner? If so, is it better practice to provide a unregister method or should I wrap them in a WeakReference? </p>

<p>The engine is using callbacks in place of events so I can perform async operations in player, monster, battle code etc. So a lot of my objects have this RegisterCallback style of method, and invokes callbacks when certain events happen within the object. If I am holding a strong reference, I'd prefer to hold a weak reference and self clean up rather than rely on objects properly unregistering. The engine provides an API that lets 3rd party users create plugins and register callbacks. I don't want to rely on the devs properly unregistering objects if I can control it within the engine itself.</p>

One thing I couldn't quite understand was one restriction on the lambda-functions: From page 4:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3.3 Preconditions
  Although lambda expressions are intended as a more con-
  cise alternative to
  AIC
  , they are not a complete replacement.
  There are several preconditions that
  LambdaFicator
  checks
  before refactoring an
  AIC
  into a lambda expression. These
  preconditions are inherent to how lambda expressions are
  implemented in Java, not limitations of our tool.
  (P1)
  AIC
  must instantiate from an interface. Instances of
  abstract or concrete classes cannot be converted to lambda
  expressions.
  (P2)
  AIC
  must have no fields, and declare only one method.
  A lambda expression represents a single anonymous func-
  tion; therefore, an
  AIC
  with multiple methods can not be
  converted to a single lambda expression.
  (P3)
  AIC
  must not have references to
  this
  or
  super
  . In
  a lambda expression,
  this
  and
  super
  are lexically scoped,
  meaning they are interpreted just as they would be in the
  enclosing environment, e.g., as if they appeared in the state-
  ment before the lambda expression [6]. However, in an
  AIC
  they refer to the inner class itself.
  (P4)
  AIC
  must not declare a recursive method. In order to
  perform the recursive call, we must obtain a reference to the
  anonymous function. While
  LambdaFicator
  could perform
  this refactoring, this could introduce unneeded complexity
  into the code and harm understandability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On P4, ""AIC must not declare a recursive method... LambdaFicator could perform this refactoring..."", how could one refactor a lambda expression to reference itself? Since by definition these lambda anonymous-functions don't have a name that can be referenced, and don't have a reference to themselves (P3 above).?</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>While developing our Android App we had a version 1.1.x live and in git.</p>

<p>We're now working on version 1.2.x in development, which is a fork of 1.1.x.  At the same time, we have to switch back to the 1.1.x line to fix bugs in what's currently live.</p>

<p>The issue is that the 1.2.x line has a new Library Project in it, which is only present in the 1.2.x branch.  I have to switch between both branches a lot to do development for both, but Eclipse isn't handling it very well.</p>

<p><strong>When switching to the 1.1.x branch:</strong></p>

<p>Problem: Eclipse complains e.g. ""AndroidManifest.xml file missing!"", because the folder for the library project no longer exists on the file system (git has deleted it - remember it's not in the 1.1.x branch).  </p>

<p>Current Fix: Click on the folder in Package Explorer, delete it.</p>

<p><strong>When switching to the 1.2.x branch:</strong></p>

<p>Problem: I deleted the folder for the 1.1.x branch, so now that dependency is missing when Eclipse goes to build the project, and there's a bunch of build errors.  To be clear, project.properties lists the dependency and it's in the Build Path - but (I don't know the terminology) the Eclipse <em>whatever</em> is missing from the workspace, and the dependency is listed as missing (shows as a red X under Project Properties > Android > Library).</p>

<p>Current Fix: Because of two different Eclipse bugs (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5784652/eclipse-invalid-project-description-when-creating-new-project-from-existing-so"">Eclipse &quot;Invalid Project Description&quot; when creating new project from existing source</a>, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6715403/some-projects-cannot-be-imported-because-they-already-exist-in-the-workspace-err"">Some projects cannot be imported because they already exist in the workspace error in Eclipse</a>), I have to Import > General > Existing ..., Browse... for the root directory, uncheck Copy, click refresh, and finally select the project and click Finish.</p>

<p>However, when I actually start acquiring images, memory consumption explodes, and every iteration chews up another 2MB in memory. I've confirmed via <code>free -s 2</code> at the command line while manually triggering image acquisition, and noticing that eventually, my application complains about not having enough memory to acquire images.</p>

<pre><code>capture = cvCreateCameraCapture(0);
while (1) {
   if (capture) {
      frame = cvQueryFrame(capture);
   }

      cvResize(frame, tmp, CV_INTER_CUBIC);
      // Do some stuff with tmp
   }
}
cvReleaseCapture(&amp;capture);
</code></pre>

<p>I've checked various posts online, and it says I'm not support to modify the data stored in <code>frame</code>. If I use <code>cvReleaseImage</code> on <code>frame</code>, it has no effect. In fact, memory usage explodes just from the <code>cvQueryFrame</code> call alone. Even the following example below causes this issue to pop up:</p>

<pre><code>capture = cvCreateCameraCapture(0);

   if (capture) {
      frame = cvQueryFrame(capture);
   }
}

<p>How do I go about resolving this?</p>

<p>Do I truly have to go with the C++ API (not really a choice for me at the moment), or is there some other way about this? This is a Gtk+-2.0 application, and the only headers I'm including are:</p>

<pre><code>/*******************************************************************************
 * Preprocessor Directives
 ******************************************************************************/
#include ""opencv/cxcore.h""
#include ""opencv2/highgui/highgui_c.h""
#include ""opencv2/imgproc/imgproc_c.h""

#include &lt;gtk/gtk.h&gt;
#include &lt;gdk-pixbuf/gdk-pixbuf.h&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There is a mix of <code>opencv</code> and <code>opencv2</code> in there it would seem, but I can't find a way to have just <code>opencv</code> headers and have access to the camera without them. I was concerned maybe this is causing certain pieces of C++-only code to be initialized in an undefined manner. Any help in resolving the memory leak or, if need be, creating the equivalent code in C++ without the leak would be very helpful.</p>

<p>Based on the info Im gathering from debugging the receiver app, it is getting into my castReceiverManager.onSenderConnected function and I can log out the event.data and useragent (iOS CastSDK,,iPhone,iPhone OS,8.1.2). It never gets into where I listen for onMessage though.</p>

<pre><code>window.messageBus = window.castReceiverManager.getCastMessageBus('urn:x-cast:com.whatever');

window.messageBus.onMessage = function(event) {

<p>Sometimes I will get an unexpected error when the recursion hits the base case:</p>

<pre><code>ERROR: In procedure #&lt;unspecified&gt;:
ERROR: Wrong type to apply: #&lt;unspecified&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I've played with different ways of expressing the base case.  I've discovered enough working patterns that I can always come up with an incantation that will behave as I intend.  But I don't really understand why some of the following examples fail and some succeed.</p>

<pre><code>(define (pt t)
   (display t)
   (if (&gt; t 0)
       (pt (- t 1))))

;;good
(define (pt t)
   (if (&gt; t 0)
       ((display t)
    (pt (- t 1)))))

;;bad
(define (pt t)
   (if (&gt; t 0)
       (pt (- t 1)))
   (display t))

;;good
(define (pt t)
   (if (&gt; t 0)
       (pt (- t 1))))

;;bad
(define (pt t)
   (if (&gt; t 0)
       ((pt (- t 1)))))

;;good
(define (pt t)
   (define (qt t)
      (display t)
      (pt (- t 1)))
   (if (&gt; t 0)
       (qt t)))
</code></pre>

<p>These are all toy procedures to help me understand the recursion mechanism.  I'd like to understand why the procedures labeled <code>;;bad</code> toss an error.</p>

<p>I suspect the problem is related to the fact the (if) is not a procedure.  If anyone can get me pointed in the right direction, I'd be grateful.</p>

<p>The scheme that I'm using is guile 2.0.11</p>

I have the second part working when NOT a function, but for this, need to enter the name of each file to be processed.  I want it automated, hence the first function with oswalk.  However, when I add the first function, which finds the files and returns them to the second function, something is going wrong.  In the code posted, I just want to test that the files are being passed and can be opened and read one at a time.</p>

<p>Notes about what is happening and pointers to the output (which will be pasted below the code) are hashed out in the code below.</p>

<pre><code>import os
import fnmatch

def findFiles (path, filter):
    Files = []
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(path):
        for file in fnmatch.filter(files, filter):
           Files.append(os.path.join(root, file))
    return Files

def fastq2SQlite(Files):
    for file in Files:
        print file    ## At this point, I have a list of files.  See ""A"" below.  

        with open(file, 'r'):  ##If this block is then added, it's evident that the files shown 
                               ##in ""A"" are not being recognized as files.  Output is ""A"" 
                               ##transposed, each line a letter of a file name.
            for line in file:
                print line

C:/Users/Documents/JKC10/test.txt<br>
C:/Users/Documents/JKC10/test2.txt<br>
C:/Users/Documents/JKC10/test3.txt<br>
None</p>

<p>I have even unsuccessfully tried to get the files to be read by modifying them so that their names become (example):
'C:/Users/Documents/JKC10/test_out.txt'</p>

<p>by adding a block that looks like:</p>

<pre><code>def fastq2SQlite(Files):
