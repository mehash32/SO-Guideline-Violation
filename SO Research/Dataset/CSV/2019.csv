<p>Same code in head but adding defer to app.js link -- works as expected:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=""https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.6.0""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script defer src=""app.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is strange to me because I thought that if I didn't use defer at all, the HTML would render, then Vue would download, then the app.js with the Vue instance would replace the mustache template HTML with the Vue data.</p>

<p>Why do I need to use defer for the mustache template to render with Vue?</p>

<p>Also weird, maybe related: if I use defer on both scripts and place at the end of the head, the mustache template HTML appears briefly (before the expected Vue value), but if I place before the stylesheet links, only the Vue version of the template mustache shows up. I'm not sure why it would affect anything.</p>

<p>Maybe these issues are related to my viewing the app with the Visual Studio Code Live Server extension.</p>

<p>Full code:</p>

<p>app.js</p>

<pre><code>new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  data: {
    playerHealth: 100,
    demonHealth: 100,
    gameIsRunning: false

<ul>
<li><p>Between the <code>""3"":</code> and <code>closing"":""00:00""},{""opening"":""00:00""</code> strings ANY number of characters can exist, it is not fixed, since stores can have 1,2 or 3 closing times. If it was fixed I would just use X amount of wildcards in my regex and I would not be asking this question.</p></li>
<li><p>Please also note that the searching of <code>closing"":""00:00""},{""opening"":""00:00""</code> string should not be done outside the bounds of the 3rd day of week. So the closing bracket <code>]</code> of the 3rd day of week should be where the matching stops, because I don't want the string to be matched in the remaining days.</p></li>

<p>*************** My solution *****************</p>

<p>In the error output, it shows that we cannot import 'HTMLParseError' from the file 'html.parser', where it was supposed to be implemented. so I did my research(<a href=""https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/html.parser.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/html.parser.html</a>) and found out that HTMLParseError was deprecated since version 3.3, and was removed in version 3.5: It turned out that this exception was never raised by the parser using default non-strict mode (which I believe is what I'm using). </p>

<p>SOOOOO basically what I did was just to remove that line of code that imports the 'HTMLParseError' from 'html.parser', located in the file (/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages/bs4/builder/_htmlparser.py)</p>

<p>and voilà! It erased the error. I don't know if it is technically correct. If someone can help me verify this solution, it would be really really appreciated!</p>

<pre><code>df = pd.DataFrame({

    'B': [7., np.nan, 1., 3.],
    'C': [4., 5., 1., 2.],

})

1  2.0  NaN  5.0  0.0
2  1.0  1.0  1.0  2.0
3  NaN  3.0  2.0  3.0
</code></pre>

<h2>Desired Result</h2>

<p>I would now like to do the following for each column of this dataframe:</p>

<ol>
<li>Calculate the sum of the column's values (ignoring any NaN values).</li>
<li>If the sum exceeds 10.0, then I want to uniformly scale down all values in the column such that the new sum is exactly 10.0 (again ignoring any NaN values).</li>
</ol>

<p>Basically I'd like to obtain a result dataframe that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>     A         B         C    D
0  3.0  6.363636  3.333333  1.0

3  NaN  2.727273  1.666667  3.0

<h2>Tried thus far</h2>

<p>The following code obtains the desired result.</p>

<pre><code>def helper_func(s):
    if s.sum() &gt; 10.:
        return s * 10. / s.sum()
    else:
        return s

result_df = df.apply(helper_func)
</code></pre>

<p>However this code feels a bit verbose and inefficient to me. Based on my experience with pandas thus far I'd suspect that a more vectorized solution is still possible. Would anyone be able to help me find this?</p>

<p>Like I said I've tried moving around the date listener but it is currently here. I expect the <code>sendDate</code> function call to well, function properly but the Logcat says otherwise. It keeps saying</p>

<pre><code>E/MessageQueue-JNI: java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke interface method 'void com.example.fragmentcommunicationtest.FragmentEntry$Callback.sendDate(int, int, int)' on a null object reference

<p>Even when not using an interface I had the same exact problem with the whole null object reference. I don't know where else to go. I've tried everything and I expect at this point it's going to be something that I have overlooked. help</p>

<p>Now, I am writing my application with Kotlin and using the coroutines library, it got me wondering how should i make the blocking network call using coroutines.</p>

<p>So I have got this bit of code:</p>

<pre><code>class DataService(val client: Client) {
    suspend fun getData(request: Request) {
        // process request

        client.makeServiceCall(...)

        //deal with response
    }
}

class Client() {
    suspend fun makeServiceCall(...) {
        library.query(....) //make a network call using the above mentioned library
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>so I am wondering if <code>Client.makeServiceCall()</code> should be actually be marked as a suspending function because it does not actually suspend, it only blocks when it makes the network call. And how should i be making the call from <code>DataService.getData()</code> to <code>makeServiceCall()</code> and still adhere to the structured concurrency principles (like parent-child coroutine relationship)?</p>

<p>The RNN is supposed to accept a sequence of numbers and output their cumulative sum.  Here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
tf.enable_eager_execution()

init_state_getter = lambda shape, dtype: np.ones(shape).astype(np.float32) # was ones

rnn = tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNN(
    1, # 1-dimensional state
    stateful=True,   
    return_sequences=True,
    activation=None, 
    use_bias=False,
    kernel_initializer = init_state_getter,
    recurrent_initializer = init_state_getter,
    return_state=False
)

x = np.ones([1,1,1]).astype(np.float32)

for _ in range(5):
    print(rnn(x))
</code></pre>

<p>and this works, we get the output</p>

<pre><code>tf.Tensor([[[1.]]], shape=(1, 1, 1), dtype=float32)
tf.Tensor([[[2.]]], shape=(1, 1, 1), dtype=float32)
tf.Tensor([[[3.]]], shape=(1, 1, 1), dtype=float32)
tf.Tensor([[[4.]]], shape=(1, 1, 1), dtype=float32)
tf.Tensor([[[5.]]], shape=(1, 1, 1), dtype=float32)
</code></pre>

<p>Now let's modify this for not eager mode:</p>

<pre><code>import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

init_state_getter = lambda shape, dtype: np.ones(shape).astype(np.float32)

with tf.Session() as sess:

    x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(1,1,1))

    rnn = tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNN(
        1, 
        stateful=True,   
        return_sequences=True,
        activation=None, 
        use_bias=False,
        kernel_initializer = init_state_getter,
        recurrent_initializer = init_state_getter,
        return_state=False
    )
    output = rnn(x)
    init = tf.global_variables_initializer()

    sess.run(init)


    for _ in range(5):
        print(sess.run(output, feed_dict={x:np.ones([1,1,1]).astype(np.float32)}))
</code></pre>

<p>This time, the RNN seems to keep losing its state, even though I am never re-initiazing:</p>

<pre><code>[[[1.]]]
[[[1.]]]
[[[1.]]]
[[[1.]]]
[[[1.]]]
</code></pre>

<p>Now I think I could explicitly feed the old state into RNN as part of the feed_dict, but (1) I'm surprised that I need to do this, given that we've set stateful=True and (2) I have no idea how to fix this if I am using an estimator.</p>

<p>I want to hide this part using C code:</p>

<pre><code>Evas_Object* image_NotSetYet = (Evas_Object *) edje_object_part_object_get(elm_layout_edje_get(wid-&gt;edjeLayout), ""warning"");
if (image_NotSetYet == NULL) {
  dlog_print(DLOG_ERROR, LOG_TAG, ""View: Unable to get warning image part"");
  return;
}
evas_object_hide(image_NotSetYet);
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried many different ways to get the Evas Object associated with this part name and hide it.  After many hours I stumbled onto some code that I modeled after, and it seems to work.  I can hide (and show) my image part now.</p>

<p>However, I later add an unrealted image to a swallow in this layout and show it.  All of a suddent the 'warning' part image shows again.  Why?  Am I hiding the 'warning' part the wrong way?  Is there something wrong with the above?</p>

<p>Alternatively, is there something wrong with the way I am adding an image to the swallow below?  The image (from file) will show up, but suddenly my warning part above shows too:</p>

<pre><code>Evas_Object *img = elm_image_add(wid-&gt;edjeLayout);
if (img == NULL) {
  dlog_print(DLOG_ERROR, LOG_TAG, ""View: Failed to add a image."");
  return;
}

// Create an image and set contents to imagefile
char *imageFileName = barcode_filename();
bool isSet = elm_image_file_set(img, imageFileName, NULL);
dlog_print((isSet?DLOG_INFO:DLOG_ERROR), LOG_TAG, ""View: %s file [%s] to image"",(isSet==EINA_TRUE?""Set"":""Failed to set""),imageFileName);
free(imageFileName);
evas_object_show(img);

// Assign the image to the swallow2 part
elm_object_part_content_set(wid-&gt;edjeLayout,""swallow2"",img);
</code></pre>

<p>I tried adding the image to the 'window' instead of the 'layout' but that didn't seem to matter.  (I've seen many contradictory examples so I don't know which is right)
I tried setting the image to the 'swallow2' part name many different ways (again, many contradictory ways show).  Is this the problem?
Otherwise, can someone explain what is going wrong?</p>

For the sake of convenience, my code always write to restart files only the real part, coded as follows:</p>

<pre><code>OPEN(UNIT = 2, FILE = filename, STATUS = 'UNKNOWN', form = 'unformatted')
    write(2) CFL
    write(2) W
CLOSE(2)
</code></pre>

<p>When I run my code in the real analysis mode, reading these files is trivial:</p>

<pre><code>OPEN(UNIT = 2, FILE = filename, STATUS = 'OLD', form = 'unformatted')
    read(2) CFL
    read(2) W
CLOSE(2)
</code></pre>

<p>But when I run in complex I have to do this somewhat clumsy hack:</p>

<pre><code>open(UNIT = funit, FILE = filename, STATUS = 'old', form='unformatted')
#ifdef COMPLEX_ON
        read(funit) CFL
        read(funit) W_t
        CFL_in = CFL
        W = W_t
#else                                                                                                                                                                   
        read(funit) CFL_in
        read(funit) W
#endif
close(funit)
</code></pre>

<p>This means that now I need two copies of the data, and if I use implied do-loops like I did previously, I can do this hack one entry at a time and the copy to the W array, but this is a slower way of handling the I/O. Is there a way to tell fortran I want to read real binary data into a complex variable array?</p>

<p>Let's imagine my GraphQL schema defines the type <code>User</code>. The data for this type comes from two sources:</p>

<ol>
<li>A user account service that exposes a REST endpoint for fetching a user's <code>username</code>, <code>age</code>, and <code>friends</code>.</li>
<li>A SQL database used just by my app to store <code>User</code>-related data that is only relevant to my app: <code>favoriteFood</code>, <code>favoriteSport</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let's assume that the user account service's endpoint automatically returns the <code>username</code> and <code>age</code>, but you have to pass the query parameter <code>friends=true</code> in order to retrieve the <code>friends</code> data because that is an expensive operation.</p>

<p>Given that background, the following query presents a couple optimization challenges in the <code>getUser</code> resolver:</p>

<pre><code>query GetUser {
  getUser {
    username
    favoriteFood
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Challenge #1</strong>
When the <code>getUser</code> resolver makes the request to the user account service, how does it know whether or not it needs to ask for the <code>friends</code> data as well?</p>

<p><strong>Challenge #2</strong>
When the resolver queries my app's database for additional user data, how does it know which fields to retrieve from the database?</p>

<p>The only solution I can find to both challenges is to inspect the query in the resolver via the fourth <code>info</code> argument that the resolver receives. This will allow it to find out whether <code>friends</code> should be requested in the REST call to the user account service, and it will be able to build the correct <code>SELECT</code> query to retrieve the needed data from my app's database.</p>

<p>Is this the correct approach? It seems like a use-case that GraphQL implementations must be running into all the time and therefore I'd expect to encounter a widely accepted solution. However, I haven't found many articles that address this, nor does a widely used NPM module appear to exist (<a href=""https://github.com/graphile/graphile-engine/tree/master/packages/graphql-parse-resolve-info"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">graphql-parse-resolve-info</a> is part of PostGraphile but only has ~12k weekly downloads, while <a href=""https://github.com/robrichard/graphql-fields"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">graphql-fields</a> has ~18.5k weekly downloads).</p>

<p>I'm therefore concerned that I'm missing something fundamental about how this should be done. Am I? Or is inspecting the <code>info</code> argument the correct way to solve these optimization challenges? In case it matters, I am using Apollo Server.</p>

All empty board locations have a button background color of white, and all occupied board locations are colored in the players colors. Now the code that controls the users moves works with no problems and so does the class AI. The method aiTurn() returns an object which contains a char to let the class know what type of move is being made, and the index's from where the character is moving from and to. </p>

<p>The code and produceure of the method works, but ever since adding the for loop (to make sure the AI completely finished its turn) only the last iteration of the for loop seems to update the background color of the buttons and all previous iterations are ignored. For example if the ai rolls a 6 and moves a piece from the home location to the main board and as results gets to roll again and rolls a 2, the result should be the home location where it was taken from should be set to white and the button on the main board 2 away should be set to the players color. However, only the main board button color is set becasue thats done in the 2nd iteration after the 2nd roll and the inital color change of the home button to white in the first iteration was not completed.

<p>I need to get values ​​from the turples in which [1] is duplicated and [3] is not duplicated. That is, in the data above, we always have the same [3] (sfp_names), and in several results of [1](Aaron Paul), that is, from this list we should only get (<code>1566767777.0, 'Aaron Paul', 'dorety1' , 'sfp_names', 'HUMAN_NAME', 100, 100, 0, '8ff7', '08f3', 'Human Name', 'ENTITY', '19fd', 0, 0)</code> and two others that have the name Aaron Paul. Since we generally have no difference in how many lists it occurs. We need to get the same value from these three lists <code>[['Aaron Paul', 'sfp_names']]</code>. But if we had a third turple with the module name sfp_names_2, then we need to get two values ​​already, since the modules are different. <code>[['Aaron Paul', 'sfp_names'], ['Aaron Paul', 'sfp_names_2']]</code>.</p>

<p>Regarding what I did myself, nothing came to my mind on this part; I just have ways to find duplicates inside the list.</p>

  for(float theta = 0; theta &lt; 2.0f*M_PI; theta += thetaStep) {

I have used the .search() function to retrieve an array of ranges and then have saved them to state.definitions in my App.js React component state.  This part works.  When I try to print out the state using console.log(JSON.stringify(this.state.definitions)), I see the ranges that I just saved.</p>

<p>In a separate function, I want to retrieve those ranges and highlight them in a new color.  This part does not work.  I don't get any errors, but I don't see any highlight changes in the document.</p>

<p>Interestingly, if I try to highlight the ranges BEFORE saving them to state, it works.  This makes me think that the ranges that I am retrieving from state are not actually the ranges understood by Word.</p>

<p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>var flattenedTerms contains an array of range items that were retrieved from Word a few lines above.  This code successfully changes the font</p>

<p>Now the flattenedTerms array, which contains the range items, has been saved to state.definitions using this.setState.  This fails to change the font.  All of the console.logs do print.</p>

  highlightDefinedTerms = () =&gt; {
    var self = this;
    return Word.run(
      function (context) {

        for (var i = 0; i &lt; definitions.length; i++) {
          console.log('Highlighting definition: ', JSON.stringify(definitions[i]));

<p>My widget xml is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;RelativeLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
    xmlns:tools=""http://schemas.android.com/tools""
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""match_parent""
    android:background=""#09C""
    android:padding=""@dimen/widget_margin""
    &gt;


    &lt;ImageButton
        android:id=""@+id/activityCheck""
        android:layout_width=""wrap_content""
        android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
        android:layout_margin=""8dp""
        android:background=""#09C""
        android:layout_centerHorizontal=""true""
        android:layout_centerVertical=""true""       
        android:text=""Hecho""/&gt;

&lt;/RelativeLayout&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The method that i need execute when the imageButton ""activityCheck"" is pressed is the next:</p>

<pre><code>
    public void changeColor(View view) {
          Log.d(""changeColor"", ""PASE POR AQUÍ"");
       ImageButton button = view.findViewById(R.id.activityCheck);
        button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            public void onClick(View v) {
                _changeColor(v);
            }
        });
    }


</code></pre>

<p>How can I do it?</p>

<p>The company has also invested in CloudForms and would like it to be used for all development environments where possible, but I am struggling to find a development pattern that works for a PHP/JS application, without adding overhead to the development process.</p>

<p>The main thing I can't get my head around (and can find nothing online for) is how one would manage to sync a local codebase to the remote dev server. This is simple with locally hosted VM solutions like Vagrant. A developer can just change a file and refresh the local website.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a pattern for this, or CloudForms-specific tool that would support live and instant code sync? The only options we've managed to come up with is an Rsync script (we found it to be unreliable) and doing commits and pulls via GIT (terrible overhead and it means we have to commit every single change just to see if solves a given issue).</p>

<p>Are we better off sticking with local VM development for this sort of software if it works?</p>
