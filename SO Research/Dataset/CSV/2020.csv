"60155827","1","","","2020-02-10 17:55:10","","4","1494","<p>In order to avoid extraneous nested HTML elements in the DOM, we're attempting to attach some data to the injected <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> AEM adds (such as classnames, a unique UUID, etc.). For this question, the component in question will be a <code>Container</code>. It is supertyped to Adobe's <code>core/wcm/components/container/v1/container</code>. In the <code>container.html</code>, we further customize it by using our own Java Model:</p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>column.html
&lt;sly
  data-sly-use.template=""core/wcm/components/commons/v1/templates.html""
  data-sly-use.column=""com.app.components.core.models.Column""
  data-sly-use.viewModel=""${'authoring/column.js' @ dataModel=column, properties=properties}""
&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Some of the data used in our component is static and and some dynamic. In this case, the <code>component-name</code> is always the same; however, we also have a dynamic piece of data like <code>component-id</code> (which in our case, is a random UUID generated in the Java Implementation) or potentially in future, other data pieces such as the <code>class</code>.</p>

<p>From what I see, we are limited to declaring dynamic data in the <code>column.html</code>, and not in <code>cq:htmlTag</code>. For example, we add our dynamic data here in that file:</p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>column.html
&lt;sly
  data-sly-use.template=""core/wcm/components/commons/v1/templates.html""
  data-sly-use.column=""com.app.components.core.models.Column""
  data-sly-use.viewModel=""${'authoring/column.js' @ dataModel=column, properties=properties}""
&gt;
  &lt;!-- Dynamic Data comes from our Java implementation, such as `container.containerUUID` --&gt;
  &lt;meta
    data-sf-component-id=""${container.containerUUID}""
    data-sf-version=""${container.version}""
  /&gt;
&lt;/sly&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Any ""static"" data can safely be placed into cq:htmlTag and it will show up on the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> which is added in the DOM, like so:</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>_cq_htmlTag/.content.xml
&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
&lt;jcr:root xmlns:cq=""http://www.day.com/jcr/cq/1.0"" 
  xmlns:jcr=""http://www.jcp.org/jcr/1.0"" 
  xmlns:nt=""http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0"" 
  jcr:primaryType=""nt:unstructured"" 
  &lt;!-- Static Data can be placed here. --&gt;
  class=""namespace-column-v1"" 
  data-sf-component=""Column"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, Dynamic data such as the ID must be nested as shown above in <code>column.html</code>, which is less than ideal in our case. Here's an example of what it looks like rendered:</p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>Rendered HTML
&lt;!-- Static data is in parent div --&gt;
&lt;div
  class=""namespace-column-v1 aem-GridColumn--default--none aem-GridColumn aem-GridColumn-- 
         offset--default--0 aem-GridColumn--default--1""
  data-sf-component=""Column""
&gt;
  &lt;!-- Dynamic data must be nested, and not on the parent div. --&gt;
  &lt;meta data-sf-component-id=""4b9eeb328439eded3045fe4cb8d8d24d"" data-sf-version=""v1""&gt;
  ...
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Is it possible, whether by using <code>cq:htmlTag</code> or some other method, to ensure the topmost parent of our component also contains the Dynamic data we desire? Ideally, this solution is O(1) and doesn't require Javascript selectors or extra libraries we need to load, just to add a class to a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>It seems like <code>cq:noDecoration</code> might be an option here, but that seems to complicate things further as I have heard this breaks the component being editable while being Authored.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help!</p>

<p>First of all, this problem has never happened in my app before today, nor did my sign-in change in any way: same Google sign-in code, same account. Everything the same for the past three months, as long as I've been testing. And, as far as I can tell, the problem only occurs with a single account. When the user begins the sign-in process, they are presented with a choice of accounts to sign in with; in this case, I selected the first user:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nnkz9.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nnkz9.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Next, Google authenticates the user and we arrive here in the code:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zg208.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zg208.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>So the question is, why did Firebase suddenly stop providing the display name (and the photo URL)? From the first screenshot, it's clear that the user has a specified name and photo. Apart from that, FirebaseAuth.getInstance().getCurrentUser().isAnonymous() is false, as expected. Any ideas on why this suddenly broke would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Method 2: MVVM pattern</p>

<p>The important part here is the <em>binding</em> parameter in the text field of the TextBox definition, which points to the PropertyChangedEventHandler.</p>

<p>C# code:</p>

<pre><code>namespace PIViewer {

            //  run some other code when the text box updates
        }
    }

    public class ProgLogic : INotifyPropertyChanged {
        private int someValue;

        public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;

        protected void OnPropertyChange(string propertyName)
        {

<p>ProgLogic now implements INotifyPropertyChanged, which notifies the View of property changes, so that Bindings are updated.</p>

Thru some help I was able to find the combination of two products in a previous question, but I still have doubts of how to achieve this result, and how I could escalate it to find more combinations.</p>

<p>I have two columns in the data frame, one of receipts and the other of products that were bought:</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>receipt_id   product_name
1            apple
1            bread
1            cola
2            apple
2            cola
2            bread
3            apple
3            cola
4            apple
4            cola
4            bread
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like to find the count of combinations of 3 products inside the receipts. So, for this example, the result should be something like this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>product1     product2     product3  count
apple        bread        cola      3
</code></pre>

<p>Which means: this first combination of products appears in 3 receipts. The count of 'apple' and 'cola' does not appear, as it was a combination of just two products.</p>

<p>I know I need to use the groupby function, but now sure of how to organize data inside the same column. Any help is aprecciated! Thanks in advance. </p>

<code>snzip -d /Path/to/file.snappy</code>. I found out that <a href=""https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">snappy-java</a> doesn't has support for decompressing such format. So I decided to use <code>org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.SnappyCodec</code> from hadoop common package. But I can't find any example of how to do it. Here is what I've tried;</p>

<pre><code>object test extends App {
    val input: Array[Byte] = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(""/Path/to/file.snappy""))
    val s: SnappyDecompressor = new SnappyDecompressor()
    val dec = s.decompress(input, 0, input.length)
    println(dec)
</code></pre>

<p>but this gives me following output;</p>

The infrastructure is simple - upload files with my API, API will encrypt + upload to Amazon S3. You can also download it, where my API acts as a middleware to decrypt the file and stream it to my client. The issue is that random data is being added to the file when downloading, but it's different every time. Is this some sort of metadata? Let me show you what I'm talking about:</p>

<p>file.txt</p>

<p>I tried base64 encoding the file before uploading to see if there is any data loss, but it works exactly the same as above:</p>

<p>As you can see, the base 64 string is still preserved, just has some sort of leadin data. Here is my encryption/decryption logic:</p>

<p>encrypt.js</p>

<pre><code>const crypto = require('crypto');
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const zlib = require('zlib');

const AppendInitVect = require('./appendInitVect');
const getCipherKey = require('./getCipherKey');

function encrypt({ file, secret }) {
  return new Promise((resolve,reject) =&gt; {
    const initVect = crypto.randomBytes(16);
    const CIPHER_KEY = getCipherKey(secret);
    const readStream = fs.createReadStream(file);
    readStream.on('data',console.log)
    const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv('aes256', CIPHER_KEY, initVect);
    const appendInitVect = new AppendInitVect(initVect);
    const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream(path.join(file + "".enc""));
    var stream = readStream
      .pipe(cipher)
      .pipe(appendInitVect)
      .pipe(writeStream);
    stream.on('finish', resolve);
  })

}

module.exports = encrypt;
</code></pre>

<p>decrypt.js</p>

<pre><code>const crypto = require('crypto');
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const zlib = require('zlib');
const uuid = require('uuid/v1');
const getCipherKey = require('./getCipherKey');


function decrypt({stream,res,secret}) {
  const initVect = crypto.randomBytes(16);
  const CIPHER_KEY = getCipherKey(secret);
  const decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv('aes256', CIPHER_KEY, initVect);
  var id = uuid();
  const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream(id+'.unenc');
  return stream.pipe(decipher).pipe(writeStream);
}



module.exports = decrypt;
</code></pre>

<p>appendInitVect.js</p>

<pre><code>const { Transform } = require('stream');

class AppendInitVect extends Transform {
  constructor(initVect, opts) {
    super(opts);
    this.initVect = initVect;
    this.appended = false;
  }

  _transform(chunk, encoding, cb) {
    if (!this.appended) {
      this.push(this.initVect);
      this.appended = true;
    }
    this.push(chunk);
    cb();
  }
}

module.exports = AppendInitVect;
</code></pre>

<p>getCipherKey.js</p>

<pre><code>const crypto = require('crypto');

module.exports = function (secret) {
  return crypto.createHash('sha256').update(secret).digest();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is there something crazy I'm doing wrong here? If upload/download to S3 login is needed here I can provide that too. I have also tested upload/download WITHOUT encryption and it works perfectly with no extra data.</p>

"59629206","1","","","2020-01-07 13:16:42","","2","1090","<p>I'm having trouble with displaying dynamically generated PDFs on a React frontend. I'm able to generate and make the PDF available for download, but the creation/placement of it into my client-side directory is causing issues where the updated state of the app is repeatedly refreshing. The app has users write a text input, analyzes it and pulls up a list of possible images from an API based on the text, then lets the user select which images they want and packages them into a pdf for downloading.</p>

<p>I'm working in a MERN stack with the create-react-app boilerplate serving a frontend application nested inside of a Node.js API directory. For the PDFs I'm using <code>pdfkit</code> to generate the PDFs on the backend and <code>react-pdf</code> to render them on the frontend. My file structure looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>client
  --public
    --pdfs
      --&lt;generated pdf saved here&gt;
  --src
    --components
      --Root.js
      --ImageSelect.js
      --ImageDownload.js
      --PDFDisplay.js
controller
  --&lt;controller receiving API call and calling model functions/returning JSON to frontend here&gt;
model
  --&lt;model generating PDF &amp; saving it here&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The process starts on a form submit in <code>ImageSelect.js</code> where I'm doing a bit of data manipulation and then making the API call to create the PDF before redirecting to <code>ImageDownload</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    const config = {
      method: ""POST"",
      headers: new Headers({
        Accept: ""application/json"",
        ""Content-Type"": ""application/json""
      }),
      body: JSON.stringify({
        script: this.state.indexedScript,
        versions: versionSubmit
      })
    };
    fetch(process.env.REACT_APP_URL + ""/api/getFinalizedImages"", config)
    .then(res =&gt; res.json())
    .then(json =&gt; this.props.handleImageSelect(this.state.indexedScript, versionSubmit, json.pdfLink))
    .then(this.props.history.push(""/imageDownload""));
</code></pre>

<p>The original user input text, selected pictures that make up the PDF, and the PDF filename are all passed to the <code>Root.js</code> router so that they can then be made available to <code>ImageDownload.js</code></p>

<pre><code>handleImageSelect = (indexedScript, versionSubmit, pdfLink) =&gt; {
    this.setState({
      indexedScript: indexedScript,
      versionSubmit: versionSubmit,
      pdfLink: pdfLink
    });
  }

    render() {
    return (
        &lt;BrowserRouter&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
          &lt;... Other Routes Here...&gt;
          &lt;Route path='/imageSelect' render={(props) =&gt; (
            &lt;ImageSelect {...props} script={this.state.submittedScript} 
            handleImageSelect={this.handleImageSelect} /&gt;
          )}/&gt;
          &lt;Route path='/imageDownload' render={(props) =&gt; (
            &lt;ImageDownload {...props} indexedScript={this.state.indexedScript}
            versions={this.state.versionSubmit} pdfLink={this.state.pdfLink} /&gt;
          )}/&gt;          
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/BrowserRouter&gt;
    );
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, in <code>ImageDownload.js</code> I'm hoping to receive the dynamically-generated PDF filename from the routing component and pass it to the <code>PDFDisplay.js</code> component for rendering:</p>

<pre><code>import React from 'react';
import { Document, Page, pdfjs } from 'react-pdf';

pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = `//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/${pdfjs.version}/pdf.worker.js`;

class PDFDisplay extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      numPages: null,
      pageNumber: 1
    }
  }

  onDocumentLoadSuccess = ({ numPages }) =&gt; {
    this.setState({ numPages });
  }

  render() {
    const { pageNumber, numPages } = this.state;
    const filePath = process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/client/pdfs/' + this.props.pdf + '.pdf';
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;Document
          file={filePath}
          onLoadSuccess={this.onDocumentLoadSuccess}
        &gt;
        &lt;/Document&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Page {pageNumber} of {numPages}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }
}

export default PDFDisplay;
</code></pre>

<p>The issue at present is that <code>ImageDownload</code> view is refreshed several times when the PDF creation form is submitted in <code>ImageSelect</code>; when it is done refreshing none of the props are passed through. I've tried a variety of other approaches like putting the API call into <code>ImageDownload</code>'s <code>componentDidMount</code> (refresh triggered another API call which meant endless refreshes/generated PDFs) and saving the PDF in a backend directory (frontend couldn't access a file outside of its directory for display), so I'm not sure what approach I should be taking here.</p>

<p>However, I disagree with this approach. I don't see why you would search for an identifier, as you could just simply access the element directly via id, which really is the idea to use an identifier.</p>

<p>You may argue that the array's find function will just do the job as it's superfast, but that's not good enough in my case as performance has highest priority.</p>

<p>As result, I currently ""misuse"" the index of the array as identifier number to access the elements directly. Sample:</p>

<p>However, I am looking for a more feasable approach in javascript/typescript to access the elements by id directly.</p>

<p>I do not need to create/update/delete the elements, I solely need to access them once fetched.</p>

<p>I must not use arrays at all if another data structure is better for this.</p>

<p>I am NOT proposing to replace an array’s field search function such as find with the direct index access. And the core of the discussion shall not be which array element is accessed by 3, as this is a simple example. The main idea of the question is if it’s feasible to use the index if an array like it was the identifier, hence to use index which directly correlates with the id field.</p>

<p>I have the following Event/State:</p>

<pre><code>class DeleteReceipt extends ReceiptEvent {
  final Receipt receipt;
  DeleteReceipt(this.receipt) : super([receipt]);
}

class ReceiptDeleted extends ReceiptState {
  final Receipt receipt;
  ReceiptDeleted(this.receipt) : super();
}
</code></pre>

<p>and the following code in bloc:</p>

<pre><code>if (event is DeleteReceipt) {
  var delReceipt = event.receipt;
  await _receiptDao.delete(delReceipt);
  print(""deleting: "" + delReceipt.snapshot.documentID);
  yield ReceiptDeleted(delReceipt);
}
</code></pre>

<p>and my widget I have:</p>

<pre><code>      if (state is ReceiptDeleted) {
        print(""delete: ""+state.receipt.snapshot.documentID);
        receipts.delete(state.receipt);
      }
</code></pre>

<p>and when I do:  <code>_receiptBloc.dispatch(DeleteReceipt(receipt));</code>
the first time I get:</p>

<pre><code>I/flutter (28196): deleting: AzgAzcn5wRNFVd7NyZqQ
I/flutter (28196): delete: AzgAzcn5wRNFVd7NyZqQ
</code></pre>

<p>which is correct, but the second time I do <code>_receiptBloc.dispatch(DeleteReceipt(receipt));</code> on a different receipt, I get:</p>

<pre><code>I/flutter (28196): deleting: d4oUjrGwHX1TvIDr9L2M
I/flutter (28196): delete: AzgAzcn5wRNFVd7NyZqQ
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that in the second time the <code>DeleteReceipt</code> event was received with the correct value, but the <code>ReceiptDeleted</code> State was received with the wrong value, and then it just get stuck like this, it never fires <code>ReceiptDeleted</code> State with the correct value, only with the first value.</p>

<p>My app is not trivial, and I have set many events and state in the past, and it worked with no issue (except this one, that probably is related <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59480113/flutter-bloc-state-not-received"">flutter bloc state not received</a>)</p>

<p>Basically I let the user create photos of receipt, that are persistent (using bloc/firestore), and I want to let the user delete them, so when the user click on a receipt, it opens in a new screen:</p>

<pre><code>Navigator.of(context).push(
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) {
      return ReceiptDetailPage(widget.receipt);
    },
  ),
</code></pre>

<p>and when the user click on delete, I show a dialog, and delete the receipt if is <code>OK</code></p>

<pre><code>var result = await showDialog(
  context: context,
  builder: (BuildContext dialogCtxt) {
    // return object of type Dialog
    return AlertDialog(
      title: new Text(AppLocalizations.of(context).deleteReceiptQuestion),
      actions: &lt;Widget&gt;[
        // usually buttons at the bottom of the dialog
        new FlatButton(
          child: new Text(AppLocalizations.of(context).cancel),
          onPressed: () {
            Navigator.of(dialogCtxt).pop(""cancel"");
          },
        ),
        new FlatButton(
          child: new Text(AppLocalizations.of(context).ok),
          onPressed: () {
            Navigator.of(dialogCtxt).pop(""OK"");
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  },
);
if (result == 'OK') {
  Navigator.of(context).pop();
  _receiptBloc.dispatch(DeleteReceipt(receipt));

<p>Do you have any idea on how to use the uses object, for my constraints ?</p>

<p>So, I am trying to create an interface on d3. I found the arc animation code (<a href=""http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5100636"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5100636</a>), and I want to change it a bit (without function arcTween()). Here is part of my code (this code is in a loop function that runs itself):</p>

<pre><code>            var arc3 = d3.arc().innerRadius(77).outerRadius(90).startAngle(0);
            var foregroundArc3 = imgs3
              .append('path')
              .attr('d', arc3)
              .attr('stroke', 'white')
              .attr('fill', 'white')
              .style('fill-opacity', 0.5)
              .attr('transform', 'translate('+(146.5)+','+(150.9)+')')
              .datum({endAngle: 0.0628*90, newAngle: 0.0628*270})
              .transition()
              .duration(1500)
              .attrTween('d',  (d) =&gt; {
                return (t) =&gt; {

                    return arc3(d);

<p>But there error: Argument of type '{ endAngle: number; newAng: number; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'DefaultArcObject'. Property 'innerRadius' is missing in type '{ endAngle: number; newAng: number; }'.</p>

<p>And in browser's console ""d"" is undefinded. I was given a solution: moving the <code>datum</code> to before the <code>.attr('d', arc3)</code> line. But, if I do this, it doesn't works (the same error occurs), since TypeScript is used.</p>

To implement this and to NOT influence other authentication providers used in our application, I've modified the sign in call as follows:</p>

<p>Before:</p>

<pre><code>await HttpContext.SignInAsync(authorizationProvider.GetClaimsPrincipal());
</code></pre>

<p>After:</p>

<pre><code>await HttpContext.SignInAsync(authorizationProvider.GetClaimsPrincipal(), authorizationProvider.GetAutheticationProperties());

public AuthenticationProperties GetAutheticationProperties() =&gt;
   new AuthenticationProperties
   {
      ExpiresUtc = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddMinutes(1),
      IsPersistent = true,
      AllowRefresh = false
   };
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>ExpiresUtc</code> is being set to 1min in the future for testing purposes; it will be computed to the end of the month once the implementation works.</p>

<p>I've expected that our identity (extending <code>ClaimsIdentity</code>) would get its propererty <code>IsAuthorized</code> false after the <code>ExpiresUtc</code> has been reached, but it doesn't. Reading <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.claims.claimsidentity.isauthenticated?view=netcore-2.1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ClaimsIdentity.IsAuthenticated</a> it states </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>true if the identity has been authenticated; otherwise, false.
  Remarks: true if the AuthenticationType property is not null or an empty string.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I'm confused.. What shall I expect after expiry occurred? Respectively, how does the identity become <code>IsAuthenticated == false</code>?</p>

<pre><code>func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, willDisplay cell: UICollectionViewCell, forItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) {

Also, I have tried referring below articles, but I was not able to figure out.</p>

<p>I could do only till 3 levels. After that, bar is not clickable.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Not sure where the mistake is, but this is what I have done so far.</p>

<p>2 Level Drill down - Works fine</p>

<p>Multilevel - Works only till Month level, cannot filter Day level</p>

<p>I create structures from this link : <a href=""http://blog.fourthbit.com/2014/12/23/traffic-analysis-of-an-ssl-slash-tls-session/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://blog.fourthbit.com/2014/12/23/traffic-analysis-of-an-ssl-slash-tls-session/</a> </p>

<p>when i run the program and connect to it using  curl -I <a href=""https://127.0.0.1:443"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://127.0.0.1:443</a> --insecure, it receives some data . <strong>the problem is</strong> when i print that data in <em>logfile</em> file , i get these value that all are incorrect except <em>type1</em> : </p>
