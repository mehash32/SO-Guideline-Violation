<p>I am working on a small piece of code to run a curl command to keep a connection open to a server so that I can receive broadcast packets when something changes, like a door is unlocked. I wrote this with Net::HTTPS in Ruby, but the controller I need to run it on conflicts with it. So, I rewrote it using PTY to cURL from Ruby. It works, but every time it disconnects every 30 seconds I need to kill the process and restart it which takes time. I'd like to just keep a PTY session open and just keep running cURL over and over when it disconnects. I'm just not getting anywhere. Below is where I'm at right now. It works for what I need but sometimes it causes macOS to throw a forkpty error and then I have to reboot the Mac mini controller. Well it was doing that before I added the process kill, but it takes a few days to show up if it does. Also, I can't use gems due to install restrictions, only stock Ruby. Thanks again.</p>

<p>2- Suppose this scenario with 2 threads:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thread B is trying to store a non-aligned value non-atomically. Store tearing occurs.</li>
<li>Thread A attempts a swap.</li>
<li>Swap fails as oldValue doesn't match. An <strong>intermediate</strong> (teared) value from memory gets loaded to our oldValue.</li>
<li>Thread A does multiplication with an <strong>intermediate</strong> value and attempts another swap which succeeds.</li>
<li>Now Thread B writes the remaining of its values to the same location partially overwriting our previous write.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm assuming <code>Thread B</code> could operate with that much delay and if so not only we
multiplied with an intermediate value, it even got partially overwritten afterwords and CAS did nothing.</p>

<li>If I assign colors manually, then it will create a disturbance in the legend. Also will be difficult to interpret and find the edges with high weight.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, I want to visualize the network with the <strong>VisNetwork</strong> library. And want to color the edges according to their weight. I found that <strong>HeatMap</strong> coloring is best for values in Weight. Is there any way to color the edges using the <strong>HeatMap</strong> functionality? Also want to add a color tray to the legend.</p>
<p>Moreover,</p>
<ol>
<li>I need to add legend as follows with range 0 to 1.</li>

<p>In my case the character to match, <code>c</code>, is <code>&quot;</code> and the number of repeats, <code>N</code>, is 3.

<li>Red from column &quot;B&quot; to be &gt; 5 in column &quot;C&quot;.</li>
<li>Green from column &quot;B&quot; have at least 2 in column &quot;C&quot;</li>
<li>Yellow from column &quot;C&quot; cannot be more than 7 in column &quot;C&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>I want it so that every time I press a button, it will have another random possibility to fit specific criteria.</p>

<p>The problem I am facing is that when the label displays <code>TextA</code>, the <code>\n</code> is recognised as the newline character and I get an output like this, which is exactly what I want:</p>
<pre><code>This is a sentence
I start the first line of the next line
Help me
</code></pre>
<p>But when the label displays <code>TextB</code> which is read from the csv file, the <code>\n</code> is not recognised and I do not get the output I desired. Instead I get it like this:</p>
<pre><code>This is a sentence\n I start the first line of the next line\nHelp me
</code></pre>
<p>What should I do?</p>
<p>I have tried both removing and keeping the <code>newline=&quot;\n&quot;</code> but it did not work...</p>
<p>I know this seems really specific but this is a vital part of the code I am working on. So far I haven't been able to find a solution or rather where to apply that solution.</p>

<p>Then I created a brand new project and try to load the 404 page still I can see a bunch of script files loading. Why is this happening in nextjs? Is there a way to load a minimum of 404 page with just only HTML and css?

<p>I have a graph that consists of two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>(:TAG)</code>'s hierarhical tree with <code>-[:IS_A]-&gt;</code> relations between parent tags and it's child(s). Note, that each banch of the tree has different levels of depth.
Every <code>(:TAG)</code> node has unique <code>&quot;name&quot;</code> (String) propery</li>
<li>Individual <code>(:IMG)</code> nodes, that have unique <code>&quot;name&quot;</code> (String) and <code>&quot;href&quot;</code> (String) properties.</li>
<li>Every <code>(:IMG)</code> is connected to at least one <code>(:TAG)</code> with the relation <code>(:TAG)-[:DESCRIBES]-&gt;(:IMG)</code>, but there could be <code>(:TAG)</code> nodes that don'c connect with any of <code>(:IMG)</code> nodes.
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GKZng.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GKZng.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></li>
</ol>
<p>I need to be able to tell any amount of tag's &quot;names&quot; and to be responsing all intersecting images nodes, but with following logic:
If every two <code>(:TAG)</code> nodes has similar parent <code>(:TAG)</code> node, so I need to response images conencted to both of them,
else (if they have different parent <code>(:TAG)</code> node), so I need to response only images that connect to both of them at the same time.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>What I already know:</p>
<ol>
<li>If I want to get images that are conencted to only intersecting tags (tag1 or tag2 or tag3), so I need the following query:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>MATCH
(img:IMG)&lt;-[*]-(:TAG {name:'Tag Name A'}),
(img:IMG)&lt;-[*]-(:TAG {name:'Tag Name B'}),
(img:IMG)&lt;-[*]-(:TAG {name:'Tag Name C'})
RETURN img
</code></pre>
<ol start=""2"">
<li>If I want to get images that are connected to every tag (tag1 and tag2 and tag3), so I need the following query:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>MATCH (img:TEST_01_Img)
WHERE
(img)&lt;-[*]-(:TAG {name:'Tag Name A'})
OR
(img)&lt;-[*]-(:TAG {name:'Tag Name B'})
OR
(img)&lt;-[*]-(:TAG {name:'Tag Name C'})
RETURN img
</code></pre>
<p>And I think have to somehow combine these two methods with (if...else) logic of combining results if images have same tag's parent and intersecting them if they have different tag's parents.</p>

<p>If there a comma in between two words under the same column, then it has to be tagged twice as shown in the row 2. If there is no comma but a white space then it has to be treated as same word i.e., it has to be tagged once. ALSO, PLEASE NOTE THAT ORDER ALSO MATTERS (row 3 and row 6). Ignore none (i.e., no words are there so no tags)</p>
<p>I have done using iteration (i.e., using iloc, for loop) but it takes huge amount of time as the data points are more than 200k and the number of tags are also more than 20. I would like to have an efficient code. Please let me know. Also, let me know if you want extra clarity regarding the question/examples.</p>

<p>You have your MyFlutterPlugin.swift file open in XCode.</p>
<p>So that we know what we're talking about the same thing, it's the file that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>public class MyFlutterPlugin: NSObject, FlutterPlugin {

    public static func register(with registrar: FlutterPluginRegistrar) {
        let channel = FlutterMethodChannel(name: &quot;my_flutter_plugin&quot;, binaryMessenger: registrar.messenger())
        let instance = SwiftMetronomeFlutterPlugin()
        registrar.addMethodCallDelegate(instance, channel: channel)

    public func handle(_ call: FlutterMethodCall, result: @escaping FlutterResult) {

    // ...

    }

<p>This file exists on disk at:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[your_plugin_project_name]/ios/classes/MyFlutterPlugin.swift</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How could you add a resource, for example an audio (WAV) file, such that it could be referenced from within MyFlutterPlugin.swift?</p>
<p>In a normal (not Flutter) IOS app, I have accomplished this by simply dragging the WAV file into XCode where it sits alongside ViewController.swift (in the same folder), and referenced it from within the ViewController like this:</p>
<pre><code>let clack_Path = Bundle.main.path(forResource: &quot;clack&quot;, ofType: &quot;wav&quot;)
let clack_URL = URL(fileURLWithPath: clack_Path!)
</code></pre>
<p>But, if I try that same approach from within MyFlutterPlugin.swift (putting the audio file alongside MyFlutterPlugin.swift), I get an error that clack_Path is null.</p>
<p>So where is the correct place to put the file, and how to properly reference it?</p>
<p>I can't find any code examples, tutorials, or documentation (at least not any that I recognize as being useful) on this specific problem.  Hopefully it's actually possible to do on IOS... I've already got the resources included and working on the Android side of the plugin.</p>

<p>Everything usually works fine on Linux as everyone uses UTF-8 based locales so all user input and arguments passed to main functions will be UTF-8 encoded. But you might still need to switch current locales to UTF-8 variants explicitly as by default C++ program starts using default <code>&quot;C&quot;</code> locale.*</p>

I am really wondering what magic is happening by Jest in order to mock modules. I am thankful for every explanation or assumption. References to other resources are also appreciated. I already found <a href=""https://medium.com/@rickhanlonii/understanding-jest-mocks-f0046c68e53c"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Understanding jest mocks</a> which is some kind of start.

<p>Now on that post are stuff like a like button and comment button, and when you click the like button, it turns blue. Now, after making a post and the post displaying, clicking the like button will make it blue. However, let's say you make another post. For that post, everything works, except when you click the like button on the second or third post, it makes the like button on the first post only turn blue, similarly with the comment button. Also, the first post has a background color of silver (#C0C0C0), however any other post, like the second or third post, don't. They have no background color.</p>
<p>This stuff (turning blue on click) is accomplished using JavaScript. What I identified from this is that the JS isn't working for any other post besides the first post. To resolve this, I tried changing the position of the JS in the code because I thought it had something to do with the scope, but it didn't.

<p>To create the production app I go to Product &gt; Archive &gt; Distribute App &gt; Copy App, and it creates a .app file with no errors (this method works for other apps without signing).</p>
<p>When I run the .app file, I see the app running in my processes, but no StatusBar icon appears.</p>
<p>Then if I switch to Xcode while the app is running, the StatusBar icon for the production app shows up. I know it's the distribution app because if I run the development build again I see two icons.</p>
